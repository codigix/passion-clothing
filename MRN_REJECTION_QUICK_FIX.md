# MRN Rejection - Quick Fix Guide

## ⚡ The Problem
Your MRN requesting "fabric" - 15 meters was **REJECTED** even though you have:
- Polyester: 15 meters (approved, active)
- Category: fabric

## 🔧 The Solution
Updated backend search to match by **category** in addition to product name.

## ✅ How to Fix It NOW

### Step 1: Restart Server
```bash
# In your server terminal
Ctrl+C  # Stop server

# Start again
cd d:\Projects\passion-clothing\server
npm start
```

### Step 2: Test Your MRN
1. Go to **Inventory Dashboard**
2. Find your pending MRN (MRN-20251011-00001)
3. Click **Review**
4. Click **"Approve & Dispatch"**
5. ✅ Should now work!

## 🎯 What Changed

**Before**:
- Searched ONLY for Product.name = "fabric"
- Your item name = "polyester" → NO MATCH

**After**:
- Searches for:
  - product_name = "fabric" OR
  - **category = "fabric"** ← YOUR CASE
  - material = "fabric"
  - description contains "fabric"
  
✅ Now finds your polyester fabric!

## 💡 Tips

1. **Specific names work better**: Use "polyester" instead of "fabric" in MRN
2. **Generic terms now work**: System matches by category
3. **Check inventory**: Items must be `approved` and `active`

---

## 🧪 Quick Test

Run this to verify:
```bash
cd d:\Projects\passion-clothing\server
node test-mrn-fix.js
```

Expected output:
```
✅ NEW LOGIC: Found 1 item
1. polyester
   Category: fabric
   Available: 15.00 meter
   
✅ MRN requesting 15 meters would be: APPROVED ✓
```

---

## ❓ Still Not Working?

Check these:
1. Server restarted? ✅
2. Inventory item has `quality_status = 'approved'`? ✅
3. Inventory item has `is_active = true`? ✅
4. Available stock >= 15 meters? ✅

If all above are YES, it should work!
