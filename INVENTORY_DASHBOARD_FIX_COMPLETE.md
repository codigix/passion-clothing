# Inventory Dashboard Fix - Complete Implementation

## üéØ Overview
Fixed the EnhancedInventoryDashboard to work with the unified Inventory table structure (post Products-Inventory merge) and added all missing API endpoints.

## üìã Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing Database Columns** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Inventory table was missing 23 critical columns that exist in the Inventory model but not in the database.

**Solution:** Created and ran `server/scripts/fix-inventory-schema-complete.js` which added:

#### Product Information Columns (23 total):
- **Identification**: `product_code`, `product_name`, `description`
- **Classification**: `category`, `sub_category`, `product_type`  
- **Measurement**: `unit_of_measurement`, `hsn_code`, `weight`, `dimensions`
- **Attributes**: `brand`, `color`, `size`, `material`
- **Pricing**: `cost_price`, `selling_price`, `mrp`, `tax_percentage`
- **Tracking**: `is_serialized`, `is_batch_tracked`
- **Metadata**: `specifications`, `images`, `quality_parameters`

#### Indexes Added (6 total):
- `idx_product_code`, `idx_product_name`, `idx_category`
- `idx_stock_type`, `idx_project_id`, `idx_sales_order_id`

#### Foreign Keys Added (2 total):
- `fk_inventory_created_by` ‚Üí users(id)
- `fk_inventory_updated_by` ‚Üí users(id)

### 2. **Removed Product Model Associations** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Routes were trying to JOIN with Product table, but product fields are now directly in Inventory table.

**Fixed Routes:**
- `GET /inventory` - Base inventory list route
- `GET /inventory/stock` - Stock listing with search
- `GET /inventory/stock-by-type` - Filter by stock type

**Changes Made:**
- Removed `include: [{ model: Product, as: 'product' }]`
- Search now queries `product_name`, `product_code`, `description` directly in Inventory
- Added proper `Op` import for Sequelize operators

---

### 3. **Missing API Endpoints** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** EnhancedInventoryDashboard was calling 4 endpoints that didn't exist.

**Added Endpoints:**

#### `GET /api/inventory/stats`
Returns dashboard statistics:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "stats": {
    "totalItems": 150,
    "totalQuantity": 5000,
    "totalValue": 250000,
    "lowStockItems": 12,
    "outOfStock": 3,
    "factoryStock": 3500,
    "projectStock": 1500
  }
}
```

#### `GET /api/inventory/projects-summary`
Returns project-wise material summary:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "projects": [
    {
      "sales_order_id": 5,
      "order_number": "SO-2025-001",
      "customer_name": "ABC School",
      "project_name": "School Uniform Project",
      "status": "active",
      "order_date": "2025-01-15",
      "material_count": 25,
      "current_stock": 500,
      "sent_to_manufacturing": 150,
      "totalValue": 50000
    }
  ]
}
```

#### `GET /api/inventory/lookup/barcode/:barcode`
Lookup inventory item by barcode:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "inventory": {
    "id": 123,
    "barcode": "INV12345678",
    "product_name": "Cotton Fabric - Blue",
    "current_stock": 100,
    "unit_of_measurement": "meter"
  }
}
```

#### `POST /api/inventory/send-to-manufacturing`
Dispatch materials to manufacturing with permanent stock deduction:
```json
// Request
{
  "inventory_id": 123,
  "quantity": 50,
  "sales_order_id": 5,
  "notes": "For Project XYZ"
}

// Response
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Materials dispatched to manufacturing successfully",
  "dispatch": {
    "id": 456,
    "inventory_id": 123,
    "product_name": "Cotton Fabric - Blue",
    "previous_stock": 100,
    "dispatched_quantity": 50,
    "remaining_stock": 50,
    "unit_of_measurement": "meter",
    "dispatched_at": "2025-01-29T10:30:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Files Created/Modified

### Created Files:
1. `server/scripts/fix-inventory-schema-complete.js` - Schema fix script ‚úÖ **RAN SUCCESSFULLY**
2. `server/scripts/test-inventory-api.js` - API testing script
3. `INVENTORY_DASHBOARD_FIX_COMPLETE.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files:

---

## üöÄ Testing Guide

### 1. Restart the Server
```powershell
npm run dev
```

### 2. Access Dashboard
Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/inventory`

### 3. Test Checklist
- [ ] Dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] Statistics cards show correct numbers
- [ ] All Stock tab displays inventory items
- [ ] Factory Stock tab filters correctly
- [ ] Project Stock tab shows project summary
- [ ] Search functionality works
- [ ] Barcode modal opens and displays correctly
- [ ] Send to Manufacturing modal works
- [ ] Materials dispatch updates stock
- [ ] View history navigation works

### 4. API Test Script
```powershell
node server/scripts/test-inventory-api.js
```

## üìä Stock Type System

The inventory uses 4 stock types:

| Stock Type | Code | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| General/Extra Stock | `general_extra` | Factory stock, not project-specific |
| Project Specific | `project_specific` | Linked to sales orders via `sales_order_id` |
| Consignment | `consignment` | Customer-owned materials |
| Returned | `returned` | Returned materials |

---

## üîÑ Data Flow

### Adding New Inventory
```
User ‚Üí Add Item Form ‚Üí POST /inventory/add-product-stock ‚Üí Database
     ‚Üì
  Creates:
    - Inventory record with all product fields
    - Barcode & QR code
    - Initial inventory movement record
    - Notification
```

### Sending to Manufacturing
```
Dashboard ‚Üí Send Modal ‚Üí POST /inventory/send-to-manufacturing
     ‚Üì
  Updates:
    - Deducts from current_stock
    - Deducts from available_stock
    - Adds to consumed_quantity
    - Creates outward movement record
    - Sends notification to manufacturing
```

### Project Tracking
```
Project Stock Tab ‚Üí GET /inventory/projects-summary
     ‚Üì
  Groups by sales_order_id:
    - Counts materials
    - Sums current_stock (what's available)
    - Sums consumed_quantity (what's been sent)
    - Links to Sales Order details
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Product Model Still Exists**: The Product model and products table still exist for backward compatibility. The `product_id` field in Inventory can optionally reference it, but all product information is now stored directly in Inventory.

2. **Migration Gap**: The migration file `20250129000000-merge-products-into-inventory.js` exists but was never run. The manual schema fix script addressed this.

3. **Stock Deduction**: When sending to manufacturing, stock is **permanently deducted** from inventory. This is tracked via:
   - `current_stock` decreases
   - `consumed_quantity` increases
   - `available_stock` decreases
   - Movement record created with type 'outward'

4. **Barcode System**: 
   - Each inventory item has a unique barcode
   - Format: `INV{timestamp}{random}`
   - QR codes contain JSON with full item details

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Shows "Failed to fetch inventory"
**Check:**
1. Server is running on port 5000
2. User has correct department permissions (inventory, admin, manufacturing, or procurement)
3. Database connection is active
4. All schema changes have been applied

### Stats Show Zero
**Possible Causes:**
- No inventory items in database (add test data)
- `is_active` filter excluding all items
- Check browser console for errors

### Projects Tab Empty
**This is expected if:**
- No items with `stock_type = 'project_specific'`
- No `sales_order_id` linked to inventory items
- Create test data with project stock

---

## üìà Next Steps

1. **Add Filters**: Location, category, low stock filters
2. **Export**: CSV/Excel export functionality  
3. **Bulk Operations**: Multi-select and batch actions
4. **Advanced Search**: Filter by date range, value range
5. **Analytics**: Stock turnover, aging reports
6. **Mobile View**: Responsive design improvements
