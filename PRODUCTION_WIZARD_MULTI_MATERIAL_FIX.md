# 🔧 Production Wizard - Multi-Material Per Project FIX

## 📋 Problem Statement

**Issue**: When fetching a project with 2+ products (approvals), only **1 material** was being loaded instead of all materials from all products.

**Root Cause**: The material merging logic in project-wise approval loading only checked:
```javascript
approval.verification?.receipt?.received_materials
```

If ANY approval didn't have a complete receipt/verification, its materials were **completely skipped**!

**Expected Behavior**: Should fetch materials from multiple sources:
1. ✅ Received materials (from receipt)
2. ✅ Requested materials (from MRN)
3. ✅ Sales order items (fallback)

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Code Changes

**File**: `ProductionWizardPage.jsx`
**Lines**: 1050-1130

#### Before (Incomplete):
```javascript
// OLD: Only checked received_materials
allApprovals.forEach((approval, idx) => {
  const materials = approval.verification?.receipt?.received_materials || [];
  materials.forEach(mat => {
    // Process materials...
  });
});
```

**Problem**: If `received_materials` is empty/null, nothing is fetched!

---

#### After (Complete with Fallbacks):
```javascript
// NEW: 3-tier fallback system
allApprovals.forEach((approval, idx) => {
  // 1️⃣ PRIMARY: received materials from verification receipt
  let materialsToProcess = approval.verification?.receipt?.received_materials || [];
  
  // 2️⃣ FALLBACK: materials_requested from MRN
  if (!materialsToProcess || materialsToProcess.length === 0) {
    const mrnRequest = approval.mrnRequest || {};
    try {
      const requested = mrnRequest.materials_requested;
      if (requested) {
        materialsToProcess = typeof requested === 'string' 
          ? JSON.parse(requested) 
          : requested;
      }
    } catch (e) {
      console.warn(`Failed to parse materials_requested for approval ${approval.id}:`);
    }
  }
  
  // 3️⃣ SECONDARY FALLBACK: items from sales order
  if (!materialsToProcess || materialsToProcess.length === 0) {
    const salesOrder = approval.mrnRequest?.salesOrder || {};
    try {
      const items = salesOrder.items;
      if (items) {
        materialsToProcess = typeof items === 'string' 
          ? JSON.parse(items) 
          : items;
      }
    } catch (e) {
      console.warn(`Failed to parse sales order items for approval ${approval.id}:`);
    }
  }
  
  // Process materials with enhanced field mapping
  materialsToProcess?.forEach(mat => {
    const key = mat.material_code || mat.material_name || mat.product_name || `mat-${idx}`;
    // ... merge/deduplicate logic
  });
});
```

## 📊 Scenario Comparisons

### Scenario 1: Project with 2 Products (Both with Receipts)

```
PROJECT: SO-001
├─ APPROVAL #1 (Product: Shirt)
│  └─ Materials: Cotton Fabric (50 qty), Thread (10 rolls) ✓ Received
├─ APPROVAL #2 (Product: Pants)
│  └─ Materials: Denim Fabric (100 qty), Thread (20 rolls) ✓ Received

BEFORE FIX:
❌ Fetches: 4 materials (by luck - both have receipts)

AFTER FIX:
✅ Fetches: 4 materials (guaranteed via primary + merge)
  - Cotton Fabric: 50 qty
  - Thread: 10 + 20 = 30 rolls (merged)
  - Denim Fabric: 100 qty
```

---

### Scenario 2: Project with 2 Products (One Missing Receipt)

```
PROJECT: SO-002
├─ APPROVAL #1 (Product: Shirt)
│  └─ NO Receipt Yet (uses MRN)
│     Materials: Cotton Fabric (50 qty), Thread (10 rolls)
├─ APPROVAL #2 (Product: Pants)
│  └─ ✓ Received Materials
     Materials: Denim Fabric (100 qty), Thread (20 rolls)

BEFORE FIX:
❌ CRITICAL BUG: Only fetches Approval #2
   - Skips Approval #1 completely (no receipt)
   - Missing Cotton Fabric and partial Thread

AFTER FIX:
✅ Fetches: All 4 materials
   - Cotton Fabric: 50 qty (from MRN fallback)
   - Thread: 10 + 20 = 30 rolls (merged)
   - Denim Fabric: 100 qty (from receipt)
```

---

### Scenario 3: Project with 3 Products (Mixed States)

```
PROJECT: SO-003
├─ APPROVAL #1 (Product: Jacket) - NO Receipt (uses MRN)
├─ APPROVAL #2 (Product: Shirt) - Receipt + Verification
├─ APPROVAL #3 (Product: Pants) - NO Receipt (uses Sales Order fallback)

BEFORE FIX:
❌ Only Approval #2 fetched
   - Loss of 2/3 materials

AFTER FIX:
✅ All 3 approvals fetched
   - #1: From MRN materials_requested
   - #2: From receipt received_materials
   - #3: From sales order items
   - ALL merged & deduplicated
```

## 🔍 Testing Checklist

### Quick Test (2 Minutes)

```bash
✅ TEST 1: Project with 2 Products (Both Approved)
  1. Navigate to /manufacturing/dashboard
  2. Go to Approved Productions
  3. Select project with 2+ approvals
  4. Check F12 Console for:
     - "✅ Grouped X approvals into Y projects"
     - "📦 Project Materials Summary:"
     - All materials from all approvals listed
  5. Form should show all materials

✅ TEST 2: Verify Material Deduplication
  1. If 2 products need same material (e.g., Thread)
  2. Check that quantity is SUMMED (10 + 20 = 30)
  3. NOT showing duplicates
  4. Console should show: "uniqueMaterials: X"

✅ TEST 3: Manual Wizard Access
  1. Try selecting projects manually in wizard
  2. Expand project → see both approvals
  3. Select first approval
  4. Materials should populate
  5. Switch to second approval
  6. Materials should update

✅ TEST 4: Fallback Scenarios
  1. Find approval WITHOUT receipt yet
  2. Navigate to wizard
  3. Materials should still load from MRN
  4. Console should show: "Found X materials"
```

### Full Test Suite (15 Minutes)

#### Test Case 1: Single Product (Baseline)
```
Given: Project with 1 approval
When: User selects project in wizard
Then: 1 set of materials loaded
  AND Console: "📦 Approval #X: Found Y materials"
  AND Toast: "✅ Loaded Z materials from 1 approvals"
```

#### Test Case 2: Two Products (Both with Receipts)
```
Given: Project with 2 approvals, both with verified receipts
When: User selects project
Then: All materials from both approvals merged
  AND Duplicate materials deduplicated with quantities summed
  AND Console shows total materials count
```

#### Test Case 3: Two Products (One Missing Receipt)
```
Given: Project with 2 approvals, ONE missing receipt
When: User selects project
Then: First approval materials from MRN fallback
  AND Second approval materials from receipt
  AND All materials present in form
```

#### Test Case 4: Fallback Chain
```
Given: Approval with:
  - NO received_materials
  - NO materials_requested
  - YES sales order items
When: User selects approval
Then: Materials loaded from sales order items
  AND Console: "Found X materials" from 3rd source
```

#### Test Case 5: Material Quantity Accumulation
```
Given: 2 Approvals both need "Cotton Fabric"
  - Approval 1: 50 qty
  - Approval 2: 100 qty
When: Materials merged
Then: Form shows "Cotton Fabric: 150 qty"
  AND Only 1 row (not 2 duplicates)
```

#### Test Case 6: Parse Error Handling
```
Given: Corrupted JSON in materials_requested
When: System tries to parse
Then: Catches error, logs warning, continues
  AND Falls back to next source
  AND Does NOT break wizard
```

#### Test Case 7: Empty Materials Edge Case
```
Given: Project with approvals but NO materials
When: User selects project
Then: Toast: "ℹ️ No materials found in approvals"
  AND Form remains fillable (user can add manually)
  AND Production order creation still works
```

## 📊 Console Logs Guide

### Success Scenario
```javascript
// Logs you should see:
🚀 Loading project-wise approvals: 42,43,44
✅ Loaded 3 approvals for project
📦 Approval #42: Found 2 materials
📦 Approval #43: Found 2 materials
📦 Approval #44: Found 3 materials
📦 Project Materials Summary: {
  totalApprovals: 3,
  totalMaterialsProcessed: 7,
  uniqueMaterials: 5,
  materials: [...]
}
```

### Fallback in Action
```javascript
// When no received_materials, falls back to MRN:
📦 Approval #42: Found 2 materials (from MRN)
// (no warning = clean fallback)
```

### Partial Failure
```javascript
// When parsing fails but falls back:
⚠️ Failed to parse materials_requested for approval #42
📦 Approval #42: Found 3 materials (from SO items)
// (recovered gracefully)
```

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Data Source Priority
```
Tier 1 (Highest): approval.verification?.receipt?.received_materials
  └─ Used when: Material receipt is finalized
  └─ Data quality: Highest (verified quantities)

Tier 2 (Middle): approval.mrnRequest?.materials_requested
  └─ Used when: Approval exists but receipt not verified
  └─ Data quality: Good (from material request)

Tier 3 (Lowest): approval.mrnRequest?.salesOrder?.items
  └─ Used when: No specific materials tracked
  └─ Data quality: Fair (generic sales order items)
```

### Field Mapping
```javascript
// Material ID (fallback chain)
mat.inventory_id || mat.id || mat.product_id || ''

// Description (fallback chain)
mat.material_name || mat.product_name || mat.name || 'Material'

// Quantity (fallback chain)
mat.quantity_received || mat.quantity_required || mat.quantity || 0

// Unit (fallback chain)
mat.unit || mat.uom || 'pcs'
```

### Deduplication Logic
```javascript
const key = mat.material_code || mat.material_name || mat.product_name || `mat-${idx}`;
// If key exists: SUM quantities (accumulation)
// If key new: CREATE new entry (addition)
```

---

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Still Only 1 Material Loading
**Solution**: 
1. Check F12 Console for error logs
2. Look for "⚠️ Failed to parse" messages
3. Verify approval data structure via Network tab
4. Ensure approvalId in URL matches actual approval

### Problem: Materials Duplicated (Not Merged)
**Solution**:
1. Check if material_code is NULL
2. Fallback key might be creating new entries
3. Check Console for actual keys being used
4. Consider using `mat.product_id` for better matching

### Problem: Incorrect Quantities
**Solution**:
1. Verify field names in each source (quantity vs quantity_received vs quantity_required)
2. Check for duplicate field names
3. Review console logs for which fields are populated
4. Consider normalizing field names in backend

### Problem: Wizard Crashes on Project Select
**Solution**:
1. Check F12 Console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify JSON parsing (try-catch logs)
3. Test with single approval first (approvalId=X)
4. Check if mrnRequest/salesOrder exists in data
