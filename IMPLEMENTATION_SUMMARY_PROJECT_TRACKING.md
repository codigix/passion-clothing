# Implementation Summary: Project-Based Tracking System

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented **project-based tracking system** across the manufacturing module. Project name (created in Sales Order as "Project / Order Title") is now the **primary key** for all data operations. This eliminates redundant product selection and simplifies the workflow.

---

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ 1. Production Wizard Simplification

**File:** `client/src/pages/manufacturing/ProductionWizardPage.jsx`

**Changes Made:**
- ❌ **REMOVED:** `productId` from `orderDetailsSchema` (line 93)
- ❌ **REMOVED:** `productIds` array validation from `materialsSchema` (line 45)
- ❌ **REMOVED:** Product selection UI from `MaterialsStep` component (line 1963-1988)
- ❌ **REMOVED:** Product watchers and auto-fill logic (line 927)
- ❌ **REMOVED:** Form default values for product fields (line 178-195)
- ✅ **KEPT:** Materials auto-loading from production approval
- ✅ **KEPT:** Material verification functionality

**User Impact:**
- Faster form completion (2 steps eliminated)
- No more product selection confusion
- Materials auto-populate based on project selection

---

### ✅ 2. Production Dashboard Enhancement

**File:** `client/src/pages/manufacturing/ProductionDashboardPage.jsx`

**New Features:**

#### A. Stage Tracking Table
- **Location:** Active Production Orders section
- **View Toggle:** Cards View ↔ Table View buttons
- **Columns:** Project | Stage | Status | Progress | Quantities | Start Time | End Time | Actions

#### B. Stage Management Actions
- **Start Button:** Changes stage from pending → in_progress
- **Pause Button:** Changes stage from in_progress → on_hold
- **Complete Button:** Changes stage to completed
- **Real-time Updates:** Table refreshes after each action

#### C. Code Additions
1. **State Management** (lines 12-13):
   ```javascript
   const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('cards');
   const [stageActionLoading, setStageActionLoading] = useState({});
   ```

2. **Stage Action Handler** (lines 52-74):
   ```javascript
   const handleStageAction = async (stageId, action) {
     // Maps action to status, updates via API, refreshes data
   }
   ```

3. **StageTrackingTable Component** (lines 162-260):
   - Displays active stages only
   - Shows all required tracking columns
   - Includes action buttons with loading states

4. **View Toggle** (lines 376-390):
   - Buttons to switch between Cards and Table views
   - Persistent state during session

**User Impact:**
- View production stages in organized table format
- Manage stage progress without navigating away
- Real-time status updates
- Clear visibility of bottlenecks

---

### ✅ 3. Project as Primary Identifier

**Implementation:**
- Project name (Sales Order number) replaces product ID
- All data fetching references project
- Single point of identification throughout workflow

**Data Flow:**
```
Sales Order Creation
    ↓ (Project/Order Title entered)
Production Approval
    ↓ (References Sales Order)
Production Wizard
    ↓ (Select by project name only)
Production Order
    ↓ (Contains project_reference)
Dashboard Tracking
    ↓ (Group by project)
Complete Audit Trail
```
