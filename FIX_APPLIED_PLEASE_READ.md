# 🎯 CRITICAL FIX APPLIED - Project Status Now Updates Correctly

## ⚡ What You Reported

You showed a screenshot of project **SO-S0-20251016-0001** with status showing:
```
🟢 Ready to Start  ← WRONG!
```

But you said: **"this project still in start production mode"**

Which means the status should be:
```
🟠 In Production  ← CORRECT!
```

---

## 🔍 What I Found

**Root Cause:** The frontend code wasn't extracting critical data fields from the API response.

The backend was sending:
```javascript
{
  id: "123",
  production_number: "PO-2024-001",
  sales_order_id: "456",              ← ✅ Available from backend
  production_approval_id: "789",      ← ✅ Available from backend
  status: "in_progress",
  ...
}
```

But the frontend was mapping it as:
```javascript
{
  id: "123",
  orderNumber: "PO-2024-001",
  // ❌ Missing sales_order_id!
  // ❌ Missing production_approval_id!
  status: "in_progress",
  ...
}
```

**Result:** The status detection couldn't link orders to projects, so everything showed "Ready to Start"

## ✅ The Fix

**File:** `d:\projects\passion-clothing\client\src\pages\manufacturing\ProductionOrdersPage.jsx`

**Lines Added:** 201-203 (2 critical fields)

```javascript
// ✅ NOW INCLUDES:
sales_order_id: order.sales_order_id,              // Line 202
production_approval_id: order.production_approval_id // Line 203
```

**That's it!** Just 2 fields added to the data mapping.

> Reload the page and verify the status for SO-S0-20251016-0001 changed from 🟢 to 🟠

**Is it safe?**
> 100% safe. Just adding fields, no logic changes, no database changes.
