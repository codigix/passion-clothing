## 🎯 3-Step Workflow

### **Step 1: Inventory Dispatches Materials**
```
Inventory User logs in
  → Sidebar: "Material Requests (MRN)"
  → Click "Dispatch" on pending MRN
  → Add barcodes to each material
  → Submit dispatch
  → ✅ Materials sent to Manufacturing
```

### **Step 2: Manufacturing Receives & Scans**
```
Manufacturing User logs in
  → Go to: "Material Receipts"
  → Open pending dispatch
  → Scan barcode for each item
  → System compares: Expected vs Scanned
  → ✅ Match → Green indicator
  → ❌ Mismatch → Red indicator + Discrepancy
```

### **Step 3: Verification & Production**
```
If ALL barcodes match:
  → ✅ Auto-approve for production
  → Materials released to production floor
  → Start manufacturing
  
If ANY mismatch:
  → ⚠️ Discrepancy report
  → Manager review required
  → Resolution: Accept/Return/Replace
```
