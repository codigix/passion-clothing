   - Describes the material composition
   
   **Color** 🎨
   - Example inputs: "Navy Blue", "White", "Black", "Red", "Khaki"
   - Describes the product color

4. Complete rest of the form and submit

### Viewing Order Details

- Color names are free text (future: may add color picker)

## 🚀 Quick Tips

1. **Be Specific**: "Navy Blue" is better than just "Blue"
2. **Include Details**: "100% Cotton, 180 GSM" is better than just "Cotton"
3. **Use Standard Names**: Helps with material procurement
4. **Consistent Naming**: Use same terms across orders for better reporting
