# Outsource Management Page - Complete Implementation Guide

## Overview
The new **Outsource Management Page** provides a comprehensive interface for managing both full production outsourcing and partial outsourcing of specific manufacturing stages. This replaces the basic outsourcing dashboard with a production-focused workflow.

## Key Features

### 1. **Full Production Outsource**
- Send entire production order to a single vendor
- All stages are outsourced together
- Vendor manages complete production cycle
- Ideal for vendors capable of full production

### 2. **Partial Outsource (Stage-Specific)**
- Outsource only specific stages (Embroidery, Printing, Washing, etc.)
- In-house production for other stages
- Mix and match vendors for different stages
- Example workflows:
  - **Embroidery**: Outsource to Specialist Vendor A
  - **Printing**: Outsource to Specialist Vendor B
  - **Stitching**: In-house production
  - **Finishing**: Outsource to Vendor C

### 3. **Dashboard Stats**
Real-time metrics displayed at the top:
- **Active**: Currently outsourced orders in progress
- **Completed**: Successfully completed outsourced orders
- **Delayed**: Orders exceeding expected delivery date
- **Total Cost**: Cumulative outsourcing expenditure

### 4. **Tab Navigation**
- **Active Outsources**: Orders currently being outsourced
- **Completed**: Successfully completed outsource operations

### 5. **Search & Filter**

## Support & Troubleshooting

### FAQ

**Q: Can I outsource the same stage to multiple vendors?**
A: No, each stage can be outsourced to one vendor. Create separate outsource orders for sequential processing if needed.

**Q: What happens if expected return date passes?**
A: Stage shows as "Delayed" in stats. Manual intervention required to update date or mark completed.

**Q: Can I cancel an outsource after creation?**
A: Currently not supported. Contact admin to cancel and reset stage status.

**Q: How are costs calculated?**
A: Enter estimated cost at creation. Actual cost can be updated through PO system.

**Q: What if vendor doesn't return on time?**
A: Track through Operations View. Manual follow-up required. Alert vendor through Notifications.

### Common Issues

1. **Outsource button disabled**
   - Ensure all required fields filled
   - Check if production order selected

2. **Search not working**
   - Refresh page to reload data
   - Check for special characters in search

3. **Vendor not appearing in dropdown**
   - Verify vendor status is active
   - Check vendor exists in system
