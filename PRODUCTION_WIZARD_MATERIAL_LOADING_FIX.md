# Production Wizard - Material Loading Complete Fix

## Issue Summary

Materials from MRN (Material Request Number) are not loading in the Production Wizard, specifically in the Materials tab (Step 4).

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. ❌ **Incorrect field mapping** - Frontend expecting wrong field names from MRN
2. ❌ **MRN not found** - Project name mismatch or MRN doesn't exist
3. ❌ **Materials array empty** - MRN exists but has no materials
4. ❌ **No error feedback** - Silent failures with no visibility

---

## Solution Overview

### Changes Made

**File:** `client/src/pages/manufacturing/ProductionWizardPage.jsx`

#### 1. **Enhanced Material Mapping** (Lines 790-840)
**Before:** Simple field extraction with limited fallbacks
**After:** 
- Proper null filtering
- Better fallback chains
- Console logging for each material
- Error handling for missing descriptions
- Includes new field: `purpose`

#### 2. **Debug Logging for MRN Fetch** (Lines 651-712)
**Added:**
- Project name being searched
- Full API response logging
- Materials structure inspection
- Detailed flow reporting
- Error messages with context

---

## How to Debug & Verify

### Step 1: Open Browser Console

1. **Start the app:**
   ```powershell
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open DevTools:**
   - Press `F12` or `Right-click → Inspect`
   - Go to **Console** tab

3. **Look for these log patterns:**

### Step 2: Check the Flow Logs

**Expected Console Output (Successful Flow):**

```
🔍 Searching for MRN with project_name: "SO-12345"
📨 MRN API Response: {requests: Array(1), pagination: {...}}
✅ MRN Found: PMR-20250315-00001 ID: 42
📦 MRN materials_requested field contains 3 items
Materials structure: [
  {material_name: "Cotton Fabric", quantity_required: 10, uom: "meters", ...},
  {material_name: "Thread", quantity_required: 5, uom: "spools", ...},
  {material_name: "Buttons", quantity_required: 100, uom: "pieces", ...}
]
✅ MRN Flow: 3 requested + 0 received = 3 to display
📦 Loading 3 material(s) from MRN request
Material 0: {material_name: "Cotton Fabric", ...}
Material 1: {material_name: "Thread", ...}
Material 2: {material_name: "Buttons", ...}
✅ Successfully loaded 3 materials
✅ Project details loaded successfully!
```

---

### Step 3: Identify Issues by Log Patterns

#### ❌ Issue: **MRN Not Found**
```
🔍 Searching for MRN with project_name: "SO-12345"
📨 MRN API Response: {requests: [], pagination: {...}}
⚠️ No MRN found for project_name: "SO-12345"
```

**Solution:**
- Check if MRN exists in database for this project
- Verify project_name matches between Sales Order and MRN
- SQL to check:
  ```sql
  SELECT id, request_number, project_name, materials_requested
  FROM project_material_requests
  WHERE project_name LIKE '%SO-12345%'
  ORDER BY created_at DESC;
  ```

---

#### ❌ Issue: **Materials Field Empty**
```
✅ MRN Found: PMR-20250315-00001 ID: 42
⚠️ MRN has no materials_requested field
✅ MRN Flow: 0 requested + 0 received = 0 to display
⚠️ No materials found in MRN request
```

**Solution:**
- Check if MRN was created with materials
- Verify materials_requested field is populated:
  ```sql
  SELECT id, request_number, materials_requested
  FROM project_material_requests
  WHERE id = 42;
  ```
- If materials_requested is NULL or '[]', populate it using the MRN creation flow

---

#### ❌ Issue: **Materials Parse Error**
```
📦 MRN materials_requested field contains 3 items
Materials structure: [Array(3)]
Failed to parse materials_requested: SyntaxError: Unexpected token...
Raw materials_requested: "corrupted JSON here"
```

**Solution:**
- MRN materials_requested has invalid JSON
- Fix by re-creating the MRN or updating the database:
  ```sql
  UPDATE project_material_requests
  SET materials_requested = JSON_ARRAY(
    JSON_OBJECT('material_name', 'Cotton Fabric', 'quantity_required', 10, 'uom', 'meters'),
    JSON_OBJECT('material_name', 'Thread', 'quantity_required', 5, 'uom', 'spools')
  )
  WHERE id = 42;
  ```

---

#### ❌ Issue: **Materials Have No Descriptions**
```
Material 0: {code: "MKL-001", quantity: 10}
⚠️ Material 0 has no description - skipping
⚠️ No valid materials after mapping
```

**Solution:**
- Materials missing required `material_name` or `description` field
- Fix MRN materials:
  ```sql
  UPDATE project_material_requests
  SET materials_requested = JSON_ARRAY(
    JSON_OBJECT(
      'material_name', 'Cotton Fabric',
      'material_code', 'MKL-001',
      'quantity_required', 10,
      'uom', 'meters'
    )
  )
  WHERE id = 42;
  ```

## Field Mapping Reference

### MRN Materials Structure (Database)

```javascript
// From project_material_requests.materials_requested
{
  material_name: "Cotton Fabric",        // ← Description field
  material_code: "MKL-001",             // ← Material ID field
  description: "100% cotton, 40x40",    // ← Alternative description
  quantity_required: 10,                 // ← Required Quantity
  quantity_received: 8,                  // ← If verified/received
  uom: "meters",                        // ← Unit
  status: "available",                  // ← Stock Status
  barcode: "123456789",                 // ← Barcode
  location: "WH-A3",                    // ← Storage Location
  color: "Navy Blue",                   // ← Fabric Color
  gsm: "200",                           // ← Gram per square meter
  width: "45",                          // ← Width in inches
  condition: "new",                     // ← Condition
  purpose: "Main fabric for garment",   // ← Purpose/Notes
  remarks: "Fire-retardant certified"   // ← Additional remarks
}
```

### Frontend Form Field Mapping

```javascript
// What gets displayed in the form
{
  materialId: "MKL-001",                // From: material_code/id/code
  description: "Cotton Fabric",         // From: material_name/description
  requiredQuantity: 10,                 // From: quantity_received/quantity_required
  unit: "meters",                       // From: uom/unit
  status: "available",                  // From: status (default: available)
  barcode: "123456789",                 // From: barcode_scanned/barcode
  location: "WH-A3",                    // From: location/warehouse_location
  color: "Navy Blue",                   // From: color
  gsm: "200",                           // From: gsm
  width: "45",                          // From: width
  condition: "new",                     // From: condition
  remarks: "From MRN PMR-20250315-00001" // Auto-set from MRN reference
}
```

## Quick Fix Commands

### Check if MRN has materials
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  request_number,
  project_name,
  JSON_LENGTH(materials_requested) as material_count,
  materials_requested
FROM project_material_requests
WHERE project_name = 'SO-12345'
LIMIT 1;
```

### Add sample materials to MRN (if empty)
```sql
UPDATE project_material_requests
SET materials_requested = JSON_ARRAY(
  JSON_OBJECT(
    'material_name', 'Cotton Fabric',
    'material_code', 'FAB-001',
    'description', '100% cotton',
    'quantity_required', 10,
    'uom', 'meters',
    'status', 'available',
    'color', 'Navy Blue',
    'gsm', '200',
    'width', '45'
  ),
  JSON_OBJECT(
    'material_name', 'Thread',
    'material_code', 'THD-001',
    'description', 'Polyester thread',
    'quantity_required', 5,
    'uom', 'spools',
    'status', 'available'
  )
)
WHERE id = 42;
```

### Verify materials are valid JSON
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  request_number,
  JSON_VALID(materials_requested) as is_valid_json,
  materials_requested
FROM project_material_requests
WHERE id = 42;
```
