# GRN Incoming Orders Fix - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Not receiving GRN requests in Inventory Dashboard
**Problem:** The Inventory Dashboard was fetching from the wrong endpoint and showing no incoming orders.

**Root Cause:** 
- Dashboard was calling `/inventory/orders/incoming?status=ready_for_inventory`
- But GRN requests are stored in the `Approval` table with `entity_type='grn_creation'`
- The correct endpoint is `/inventory/grn-requests`

**Solution:** Updated the InventoryDashboard to fetch from the correct endpoint.

### Issue 2: Goods Receipt (GRN) page didn't show incoming POs
**Problem:** The GoodsReceiptNotePage only showed existing GRNs but didn't display Purchase Orders awaiting GRN creation.

**Solution:** Added a tabbed interface with:
1. **Pending GRN Creation** tab - Shows POs awaiting GRN creation
2. **All GRNs** tab - Shows existing GRNs (original functionality)

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. InventoryDashboard.jsx (`client/src/pages/dashboards/`)

**Updated API Call:**
```javascript
// OLD - Wrong endpoint
const response = await api.get('/inventory/orders/incoming?status=ready_for_inventory');

// NEW - Correct endpoint
const response = await api.get('/inventory/grn-requests');
```

**Updated Table Structure:**
- Changed columns to match GRN request data structure
- Now displays: PO Number, Vendor, PO Date, Expected Delivery, Items, Amount, Requested By
- Added "Create GRN" and "View PO" action buttons
- Updated tab title to "GRN Requests - Purchase Orders Awaiting Receipt"

### 2. GoodsReceiptNotePage.jsx (`client/src/pages/inventory/`)

**Added New State:**
```javascript
const [pendingPOs, setPendingPOs] = useState([]);
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('pending'); // 'pending' or 'grns'
```

**Added New Function:**
```javascript
const fetchPendingPOs = async () => {
  const response = await api.get('/inventory/grn-requests');
  setPendingPOs(response.data.requests || []);
};
```

**New UI Features:**
- **Two-tab interface:**
  1. **Pending GRN Creation Tab** (default)
     - Shows all approved POs awaiting GRN creation
     - Displays badge count
     - Quick "Create GRN" button for each PO
  2. **All GRNs Tab**
     - Original GRN list with filters
     - Search and status filtering

### 3. Sidebar.jsx (`client/src/components/layout/`)

**Added Badge Counter for Inventory Department:**
- Added `pendingGRNCount` state
- Added `fetchPendingGRNCount()` function
- Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- Shows red badge on "Goods Receipt (GRN)" menu item
- Only active for `inventory` and `admin` departments

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const [pendingGRNCount, setPendingGRNCount] = useState(0);

useEffect(() => {
  if (user?.department === 'inventory' || user?.department === 'admin') {
    fetchPendingGRNCount();
    const interval = setInterval(fetchPendingGRNCount, 30000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }
}, [user?.department]);
```
