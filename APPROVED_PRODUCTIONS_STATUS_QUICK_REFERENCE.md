→ Verify sales_order_id is set in orders
```

### Button Not Responding?
```
→ Check if button is disabled (gray color)
→ Try refreshing page
→ Check browser console for errors
```

### Order Reference Missing?
```
→ Ensure production_approval_id is set when creating order
→ Verify order.id is not null
→ Check that order was saved to database
```
