## Overview
This document outlines the major enhancements made to the Procurement module, including fixes to View/Edit functionality, unified Vendor Management, and enhanced Incoming Orders tracking.

## ✅ Changes Implemented

**What Changed:**
- The "Incoming Orders" tab now displays **BOTH** Sales Orders and Purchase Orders
- Sales Orders section shows orders sent from Sales department requiring material procurement
- Purchase Orders section shows draft, pending approval, and sent POs

**Features:**

```

**Visual Organization:**
```
┌─ Incoming Orders Tab ────────────────────────────┐
│                                                   │

```

### 2. **Unified Vendor Management Page**

**Location:** `client/src/pages/procurement/VendorManagementPage.jsx` (NEW FILE)

**What Changed:**
- Created a new unified page that combines three separate pages:
  1. Vendor Details (from VendorsPage)
  2. Goods Receipt (from GoodsReceiptPage)
  3. Vendor Performance (from VendorPerformancePage)

**Features:**
- ✅ Single page with tab navigation
- ✅ Sticky header with back button to dashboard
- ✅ Three tabs with icons:
  - 🏢 **Vendor Details** - Full vendor CRUD operations
  - 📄 **Goods Receipt** - Track and manage goods received from vendors
  - ⭐ **Vendor Performance** - Monitor vendor ratings and metrics
- ✅ Smooth transitions between tabs
- ✅ Professional UI with icons and proper spacing

**Route:**
```
/procurement/vendor-management
```

**Tab Components:**
```javascript
const tabs = [
  { id: 0, label: 'Vendor Details', icon: Building, component: VendorsPage },
  { id: 1, label: 'Goods Receipt', icon: Receipt, component: GoodsReceiptPage },
  { id: 2, label: 'Vendor Performance', icon: Star, component: VendorPerformancePage },
];
```

**Navigation:**
- Dashboard header button now links to `/procurement/vendor-management`
- Individual pages still accessible via direct routes (for backward compatibility)
- Back button returns to Procurement Dashboard

---

### 3. **View/Edit Modal Verification**

**Status:** ✅ Already Working Correctly

**Locations:**
- `client/src/components/procurement/VendorForm.jsx`
- `client/src/components/procurement/PurchaseOrderForm.jsx`

**Confirmed Features:**
- Both forms properly support three modes:
  - `create` - Empty form for new records
  - `edit` - Editable form with existing data
  - `view` - Read-only display of existing data

**View Mode Implementation:**
```javascript
const isViewMode = mode === 'view';

// All input fields have:
disabled={isViewMode}

// Action buttons hidden in view mode:
{!isViewMode && (
  <button>Add Item</button>
)}
```

**Modal Titles:**
- Create: "Add New Vendor" / "Create Purchase Order"
- Edit: "Edit Vendor" / "Edit Purchase Order"  
- View: "Vendor Details" / "View Purchase Order"

## 🔗 Navigation Structure

```
Procurement Dashboard
├── Header Actions
│   ├── Vendor Management → /procurement/vendor-management
│   └── Create Purchase Order → /procurement/purchase-orders
│
└── Tabs
    ├── Incoming Orders (Combined View)
    │   ├── Sales Orders → Create PO
    │   └── Purchase Orders → View/Edit
    │
    ├── Purchase Orders → /procurement/purchase-orders
    │
    ├── Vendor Management (Legacy tabs - can be removed)
    ├── Goods Receipt (Legacy tabs - can be removed)
    └── Vendor Performance (Legacy tabs - can be removed)

## 📊 Technical Details

### State Management:
```javascript
// Procurement Dashboard
const [incomingOrders, setIncomingOrders] = useState([]); // Sales Orders
const [incomingPurchaseOrders, setIncomingPurchaseOrders] = useState([]); // POs
const [tabValue, setTabValue] = useState(0); // Active tab

// Vendor Management Page
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState(0); // 0: Details, 1: GRN, 2: Performance
```

### API Integration:
```javascript
// Fetch both order types in parallel
const incomingRes = await api.get('/sales/orders?status=sent_to_procurement&limit=20');
const incomingPORes = await api.get('/procurement/pos?status=draft,pending_approval,sent&limit=20');

// Calculate combined count
const totalIncoming = (incomingRes.data.orders?.length || 0) + 
                     (incomingPORes.data.purchaseOrders?.length || 0);
```

### Form Mode Handling:
```javascript
// Component receives mode prop
const { mode } = props; // 'create' | 'edit' | 'view'

// Derive view mode flag
const isViewMode = mode === 'view';

// Apply to all inputs
<input
  value={formData.field}
  onChange={handleChange}
  disabled={isViewMode}
/>

// Conditional rendering
{!isViewMode && <button>Save</button>}
```
