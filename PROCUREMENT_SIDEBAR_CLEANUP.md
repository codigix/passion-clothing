# Procurement Sidebar and Dashboard Cleanup

## 📋 Summary

Cleaned up the Procurement sidebar navigation by removing unnecessary items that either don't exist or should only be accessible through workflow buttons.

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Removed from Procurement Sidebar Navigation**

#### ❌ "Create Purchase Order" Link (Line 97)
- **Reason**: This page should only be accessible when clicking "Create Purchase Order" button in the dashboard or purchase orders page
- **Access Method**: Available through:
  - Dashboard → "Create Purchase Order" button (top right)
  - Purchase Orders page → "Create Purchase Order" button
  - Incoming Orders → "Create PO" button (for specific sales order)

#### ❌ "Production Requests" Link (Line 99)
- **Reason**: This is not a procurement function - production requests are managed by manufacturing department
- **Access Method**: Manufacturing department has their own production requests page

### 2. **Dashboard Already Implements Smart Actions**

The Procurement Dashboard (`ProcurementDashboard.jsx`) already has the correct logic for showing PO creation status:

#### **Incoming Orders Section - Action Buttons**
Located at lines 460-485 in `ProcurementDashboard.jsx`:

```javascript
{order.status === 'confirmed' && (
  <>
    {order.linkedPurchaseOrder ? (
      // ✅ PO ALREADY CREATED - Show success status
      <button
        onClick={() => navigate(`/procurement/purchase-orders/${order.linkedPurchaseOrder.id}`)}
        className="px-3 py-1 bg-green-100 text-green-700 text-xs rounded border border-green-300"
      >
        <CheckCircle className="w-3 h-3" />
        PO Created ✓
      </button>
    ) : (
      // ❌ NO PO YET - Show create button
      <button
        onClick={() => handleCreatePO(order)}
        className="px-3 py-1 bg-blue-600 text-white text-xs rounded"
      >
        <Plus className="w-3 h-3" />
        Create PO
      </button>
    )}
  </>
)}
```

**How it Works:**
1. When a sales order arrives in procurement with status = 'confirmed'
2. If `order.linkedPurchaseOrder` exists → Shows **"PO Created ✓"** (green, clickable to view PO)
3. If no PO linked yet → Shows **"Create PO"** button (blue, navigates to create page)

## 🔧 Backend Configuration

### **Sales Order ↔ Purchase Order Linking**

**Database Association** (`server/config/database.js` line 112-117):
```javascript
PurchaseOrder.belongsTo(SalesOrder, { 
  foreignKey: 'linked_sales_order_id', 
  as: 'salesOrder' 
});

SalesOrder.hasOne(PurchaseOrder, { 
  foreignKey: 'linked_sales_order_id', 
  as: 'linkedPurchaseOrder' 
});
```

**Sales Orders API** (`server/routes/sales.js` line 364-369):
```javascript
include: [
  { 
    model: PurchaseOrder, 
    as: 'linkedPurchaseOrder', 
    attributes: ['id', 'po_number', 'status', 'po_date'],
    required: false // LEFT JOIN - includes orders without POs
  }
]
```

**Purchase Order Model** (`server/models/PurchaseOrder.js` line 38-45):
```javascript
linked_sales_order_id: {
  type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
  allowNull: true,
  references: {
    model: 'sales_orders',
    key: 'id'
  }
}
```
