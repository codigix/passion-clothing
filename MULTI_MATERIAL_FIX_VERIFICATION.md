## 🎯 Implementation Verification

### Code Changes Verified
```
File: ProductionWizardPage.jsx
Location: Lines 1050-1130
Status: ✅ CONFIRMED - Changes in place and correct
```

### Change #1: 3-Tier Fallback System ✅
```javascript
// ✅ VERIFIED - Primary: receipt materials
let materialsToProcess = approval.verification?.receipt?.received_materials || [];

// ✅ VERIFIED - Fallback 1: MRN materials
if (!materialsToProcess?.length) {
  const requested = mrnRequest.materials_requested;
  materialsToProcess = JSON.parse(requested);
}

// ✅ VERIFIED - Fallback 2: SO items
if (!materialsToProcess?.length) {
  const items = salesOrder.items;
  materialsToProcess = JSON.parse(items);
}
```

### Change #2: Enhanced Field Mapping ✅
```javascript
// ✅ VERIFIED - Better ID mapping
materialId: String(mat.inventory_id || mat.id || mat.product_id || '')

// ✅ VERIFIED - Better description mapping
description: mat.material_name || mat.product_name || mat.name || 'Material'

// ✅ VERIFIED - Better quantity mapping
requiredQuantity: mat.quantity_received || mat.quantity_required || mat.quantity || 0

// ✅ VERIFIED - Better unit mapping
unit: mat.unit || mat.uom || 'pcs'
```

### Change #3: Console Logging ✅
```javascript
// ✅ VERIFIED - Per-approval logging
console.log(`📦 Approval #${approval.id}: Found ${materialsToProcess?.length || 0} materials`);

// ✅ VERIFIED - Summary logging
console.log(`📦 Project Materials Summary:`, {
  totalApprovals: allApprovals.length,
  totalMaterialsProcessed: totalMaterialsCount,
  uniqueMaterials: mergedMaterials.size,
  materials: [...]
});
```

### Change #4: Toast Messages ✅
```javascript
// ✅ VERIFIED - Success message
toast.success(`✅ Loaded ${materialsArray.length} materials from ${allApprovals.length} approvals (merged & deduplicated)`);

// ✅ VERIFIED - Empty case handling
toast.info('ℹ️ No materials found in approvals. You can add them manually.');
```

## 🧪 Test Readiness

### Pre-Test Checklist ✅
```
✅ Code changes verified in file
✅ Fallback logic in place
✅ Error handling present
✅ Console logging added
✅ Toast messages configured
✅ No syntax errors
✅ File structure intact
✅ No breaking changes
```

### How to Test (2 Minutes)

#### Test Step 1: Browser Setup
```
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Open F12 Developer Console (F12)
4. Go to Console tab
```

#### Test Step 2: Navigate to Wizard
```
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/manufacturing/wizard
2. You should see the order selection form
```

#### Test Step 3: Select Multi-Product Project
```
1. Look at project list
2. Find project showing "2 approvals" or more
3. Click to expand project
4. Select first approval
```

#### Test Step 4: Check Console Output
```
1. In F12 Console, you should see:
   
   ✅ "🚀 Loading project-wise approvals: 42,43"
   ✅ "✅ Loaded 2 approvals for project"
   ✅ "📦 Approval #42: Found X materials"
   ✅ "📦 Approval #43: Found Y materials"
   ✅ "📦 Project Materials Summary: { ... }"
```

#### Test Step 5: Verify Materials
```
1. Scroll down to Materials section
2. Should see materials from BOTH approvals
3. If both need "Thread":
   - Should show SINGLE "Thread" row
   - Quantity should be SUMMED (not duplicated)
4. No missing materials
```

#### Test Step 6: Success Indicators
```
✅ Console shows per-approval material counts
✅ Console shows total materials count
✅ Materials form populated with all items
✅ No duplicate material rows
✅ Quantities properly merged
✅ Toast says "merged & deduplicated"
```

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Console Output Breakdown

```javascript
// Log Entry 1 - Project loading started
🚀 Loading project-wise approvals: 42,43,44

// Log Entry 2 - All approvals fetched
✅ Loaded 3 approvals for project

// Log Entries 3-5 - Per-approval material count
📦 Approval #42: Found 2 materials
📦 Approval #43: Found 3 materials
📦 Approval #44: Found 2 materials

// Log Entry 6 - Summary with statistics
📦 Project Materials Summary: {
  totalApprovals: 3,
  totalMaterialsProcessed: 7,      // 2+3+2
  uniqueMaterials: 5,               // After deduplication (1 duplicate)
  materials: [
    { key: "fabric", description: "Cotton", quantity: 50, unit: "meters" },
    { key: "thread", description: "Thread", quantity: 30, unit: "rolls" },
    { key: "denim", description: "Denim", quantity: 100, unit: "meters" },
    { key: "buttons", description: "Buttons", quantity: 200, unit: "pcs" },
    { key: "zipper", description: "Zipper", quantity: 10, unit: "pcs" }
  ]
}

// Toast notification
✅ Loaded 5 materials from 3 approvals (merged & deduplicated)
```

### Form Display
```
Materials Tab should show:
  ✓ Cotton - 50 meters
  ✓ Thread - 30 rolls (merged from 10+10+10)
  ✓ Denim - 100 meters
  ✓ Buttons - 200 pcs
  ✓ Zipper - 10 pcs
  
NOT showing: Duplicates, missing items, incorrect quantities
```

## 🎯 Key Verification Points

### Point 1: Fallback Chain Works
```
Question: If first source empty, does it check second?
Verification:
  - Find approval without receipt
  - Check console for "Found X materials"
  - If showing materials from fallback source, ✅ PASS
```

### Point 2: Deduplication Works
```
Question: Are duplicate materials merged correctly?
Verification:
  - Find project where 2+ approvals need same material
  - Check form shows SINGLE row (not duplicates)
  - Check quantity is SUMMED (not separate)
  - If yes, ✅ PASS
```

### Point 3: Logging Shows Progress
```
Question: Can I see which approval provided materials?
Verification:
  - Open console
  - Should see "📦 Approval #X: Found Y materials" for EACH
  - Summary should show total counts
  - If yes, ✅ PASS
```

### Point 4: Error Handling Works
```
Question: Does system continue if one approval has bad data?
Verification:
  - Try project with mixed quality data
  - Look for "⚠️" warnings in console
  - Check if other approvals still load
  - Should continue gracefully, ✅ PASS
```

### Point 5: Backward Compatible
```
Question: Does old single-approval flow still work?
Verification:
  - Try using approvalId=X parameter
  - Check if old flow triggers
  - Should work exactly as before, ✅ PASS
```
