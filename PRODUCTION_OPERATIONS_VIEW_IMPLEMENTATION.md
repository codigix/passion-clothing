# Production Operations View - Stage-by-Stage Tracking Interface

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive stage-by-stage production tracking interface that provides detailed visibility and control over each production stage.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New Page Component
**File:** `client/src/pages/manufacturing/ProductionOperationsViewPage.jsx`

A full-featured production operations view page with:

#### Left Sidebar - Production Stages
- Visual list of all production stages
- Status indicators with icons:
  - ‚úÖ **Completed** - Green checkmark
  - üïê **In Progress** - Blue clock
  - ‚è∏Ô∏è **On Hold** - Orange pause icon
  - ‚è±Ô∏è **Pending** - Gray clock
- Click to select any stage
- Current selected stage highlighted with red border
- Status badges for each stage

#### Right Panel - Detailed Stage Information
- **Stage Header**
  - Stage name (formatted and capitalized)
  - Current status badge
  - Edit Details / Save Changes button

- **Quick Actions** (Context-Sensitive)
  - **For Pending Stages:**
    - ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Stage (green button)
    - ‚è∏Ô∏è Hold (orange button)
  - **For In-Progress Stages:**
    - ‚è∏Ô∏è Pause (orange button)
    - ‚úÖ Complete (blue button)

- **Stage Details Form** (Edit Mode Available)
  - **Status Dropdown:** Pending | In Progress | Completed | On Hold
  - **Start Date & Time:** Date and time pickers
  - **End Date & Time:** Date and time pickers
  - **Duration:** Auto-calculated based on start/end times
  
- **Quantity Tracking** (4 fields)
  - Processed
  - Approved
  - Rejected
  - Material Used

- **Notes Section**
  - Large textarea for stage-specific notes
  - Displays "No notes added" when empty

- **Stage Navigation**
  - ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Previous Stage button
  - ‚û°Ô∏è Next Stage button
  - Stage counter: "Stage X of Y"
  - Buttons disabled at boundaries

#### Top Section
- **Back Button** - Returns to Manufacturing Dashboard
- **Production Order Header**
  - Production number
  - Product name and quantity
- **Overall Progress Bar**
  - Shows percentage complete
  - Red progress bar with percentage label
  - Calculated based on completed stages

### 2. Routing Configuration
**File:** `client/src/App.jsx`

Added:
```jsx
import ProductionOperationsViewPage from './pages/manufacturing/ProductionOperationsViewPage';

// Route
<Route path="/manufacturing/orders/:id" element={<ProductionOperationsViewPage />} />
```

### 3. Navigation Integration
The existing `handleViewOrder` function in `ManufacturingDashboard.jsx` already navigates to `/manufacturing/orders/${order.id}`, so clicking "View Details" on any active production order now opens this new interface.

## Features

### 1. Real-Time Stage Management
- **Start Stage:** Begin work on a pending stage
- **Pause Stage:** Temporarily pause in-progress work
- **Complete Stage:** Mark stage as done (with quantity tracking)
- **Hold Stage:** Put stage on hold (with reasons)

### 2. Edit Mode
- Toggle between view and edit modes
- Edit all stage details:
  - Status
  - Start/End dates and times
  - Quantity metrics
  - Notes
- Save all changes with single button click

### 3. Quantity Tracking
Track 4 key metrics per stage:
- **Processed:** Total items processed
- **Approved:** Items that passed quality
- **Rejected:** Items that failed
- **Material Used:** Raw materials consumed

### 4. Duration Calculation
- Automatically calculates duration between start and end times
- Displays in hours or minutes
- Shows "Not calculated" if times missing

### 5. Visual Status Indicators
- Color-coded stage cards (green, blue, orange, gray)
- Status badges with consistent styling
- Icon indicators for each status
- Selected stage highlighted with red border

### 6. Responsive Design
- Clean, modern UI using Tailwind CSS
- Lucide React icons for consistency
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Fixed-height scrollable sections

## Backend Endpoints Used

All endpoints already exist in `server/routes/manufacturing.js`:

1. **GET** `/manufacturing/orders/:id` - Fetch production order with stages
2. **POST** `/manufacturing/stages/:id/start` - Start a stage
3. **POST** `/manufacturing/stages/:id/pause` - Pause a stage
4. **POST** `/manufacturing/stages/:id/complete` - Complete a stage
5. **POST** `/manufacturing/stages/:id/hold` - Put stage on hold
6. **PUT** `/manufacturing/stages/:id` - Update stage details

## User Flow

### Accessing the Operations View
1. Navigate to Manufacturing Dashboard
2. Go to "Production Tracking" tab
3. Find an active production order
4. Click the **Eye icon (üëÅÔ∏è View Details)** button
5. Opens detailed stage-by-stage operations view

### Working with Stages
1. **Select Stage:** Click any stage in left sidebar
2. **View Details:** See all stage information in right panel
3. **Take Action:** Use Quick Actions buttons
4. **Edit Details:** Click "Edit Details" to modify stage data
5. **Save Changes:** Click "Save Changes" after editing
6. **Navigate:** Use Previous/Next buttons to move between stages

### Example Workflow

## UI Screenshots Reference

The interface matches the provided screenshots with:
- Left sidebar showing sequential stages

- Quick action buttons (Start Stage, Pause, Complete, Hold)
- Edit mode with Save Changes button
- Date/time pickers for start and end
- Quantity tracking grid
- Notes textarea
- Previous/Next navigation

## Technical Details

### State Management
- Uses React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Fetches data on component mount
- Auto-selects first in-progress or pending stage
- Refreshes data after stage actions

### Form Handling
- Controlled inputs for all fields
- Date and time stored separately in state
- Combined when sending to backend
- Validation handled by backend

### Error Handling
- Toast notifications for all actions
- Error messages from backend displayed
- Loading states for async operations
- Graceful handling of missing data

### URL Parameters
- Uses React Router's `useParams()` to get order ID
- Dynamic route: `/manufacturing/orders/:id`
