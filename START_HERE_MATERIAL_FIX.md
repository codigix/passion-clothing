# 🎯 START HERE - Material Loading Fix Complete

## ✅ What Was Fixed

Your Production Wizard had **material loading issues** in Step 4. Materials from MRN (Material Request Number) were not appearing, and there was **no feedback** to help diagnose why.

**Issues Fixed:**
1. ✅ Silent failures - now you see detailed console logs
2. ✅ No validation - now invalid materials are filtered out
3. ✅ Limited field mapping - now supports more fallback options
4. ✅ No error messages - now clear error messages guide you
5. ✅ Hard to debug - now fully visible data flow

## 🚀 Do This Now (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Start Your App
```powershell
npm start
```

### Step 2: Open Browser Console
- Press `F12`
- Click **Console** tab
- Keep it open

### Step 3: Test Material Loading
```
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/manufacturing/wizard
2. Step 1: Select ANY project/sales order
3. Step 4: Check CONSOLE (not UI yet!)
4. Look for:
   ✅ "✅ Successfully loaded X materials" 
      → Everything works!
   
   ⚠️ "⚠️ No MRN found"
      → MRN doesn't exist (see fix below)
   
   ⚠️ "⚠️ MRN has no materials"
      → MRN empty (see fix below)
   
   ❌ "Failed to parse materials"
      → Database error (contact admin)
```

## 🔍 What You'll See

### Console Output (Success Case)
```
🔍 Searching for MRN with project_name: "SO-12345"
✅ MRN Found: PMR-20250315-00001
📦 Loading 3 material(s) from MRN request
✅ Successfully loaded 3 materials
```

### UI Output (Success Case)
```
Step 4: Materials
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📦 Materials loaded from MRN     │
│ 3 material(s) fetched from MRN   │
│                                  │
│ 📌 Material #1: Cotton Fabric    │
│ 📌 Material #2: Thread           │
│ 📌 Material #3: Buttons          │
└──────────────────────────────────┘

## ⚡ Quick Fixes

### Issue 1: "⚠️ No MRN found"

**Database Check:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM project_material_requests 
WHERE project_name LIKE '%SO-12345%'
```

**If empty:**
- MRN doesn't exist
- Solution: Create MRN for this project before making production order

**If found:**
- Project name mismatch
- Solution: Check console log for exact project_name being searched and verify it matches

---

### Issue 2: "⚠️ MRN has no materials"

**Database Check:**
```sql
SELECT materials_requested 
FROM project_material_requests 
WHERE id = 42
```

**If NULL or empty:**
- MRN has no materials
- Solution: Run this to add sample materials:

```sql
UPDATE project_material_requests
SET materials_requested = JSON_ARRAY(
  JSON_OBJECT(
    'material_name', 'Cotton Fabric',
    'material_code', 'FAB-001',
    'quantity_required', 10,
    'uom', 'meters',
    'color', 'Navy Blue'
  ),
  JSON_OBJECT(
    'material_name', 'Thread',
    'material_code', 'THD-001',
    'quantity_required', 5,
    'uom', 'spools'
  )
)
WHERE id = 42;
```

Then refresh browser and try again.

### Issue 3: "Failed to parse materials"

- Database corruption in materials_requested field
- Contact database admin to investigate/fix
