# 🏭 Manufacturing Dashboard - Start Production Flow Fix

## 🎯 The Issue

You click **"Start Production"** on the Manufacturing Dashboard and... 💥

```
❌ Error Alert: "Failed to start production"
❌ Console Error: 404 Not Found /manufacturing/start-production/123
❌ Stuck on dashboard, can't create production order
```

**Root Cause:** The button called an API endpoint that doesn't exist!

---

## ✅ The Fix

Now when you click **"Start Production"**:

```
✅ Page navigates to Production Wizard
✅ URL shows: /manufacturing/wizard?salesOrderId=123
✅ Form auto-fills with:
   • Sales Order details
   • Quantity
   • Customer name
   • Delivery date
   • Project reference
✅ You see pre-filled form ready to submit
✅ Create production order in seconds
```

**What Changed:**
1. **Dashboard button** - Now navigates to wizard instead of calling broken API
2. **Production wizard** - Now reads URL parameter and auto-fills form with sales order data
