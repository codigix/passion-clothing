## üîÑ Filter Logic

### How Filters Work Together

**All filters use AND logic:**
- Status = "Pending" **AND**
- Priority = "Urgent" **AND**  
- Project = "SO-2024"

Results: Only requests matching ALL criteria shown

**NOT OR logic:**
- Status = "Pending" **OR** "Approved"
- To get this: You must apply filter twice separately

### Clearing Filters

**Individual reset:** Just change the dropdown back to "All" or clear text

**Bulk reset:** Click **"Reset"** button to clear everything

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Discrepancies**: When status shows "DISCREPANCY", contact receiving department
2. **Date Filters**: Use for compliance/audit trails
3. **Project Tracking**: Ensures all materials accounted for
4. **Priority Levels**: "Urgent" needs immediate attention
