# Auto-Redirect Issue - Fixed ✅

## Problem Description

Users were experiencing automatic redirects in two scenarios:

1. **After Some Time:** Automatically logged out or redirected after being logged in
2. **On Page Refresh:** Automatically redirected to admin dashboard regardless of actual user department

---

## Root Causes Identified

### 🔴 **Primary Issue: Development Mode Mock User**

**Location:** `server/middleware/auth.js` (lines 6-20)

**Problem:**
```javascript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && !req.path.startsWith('/api/auth/login')) {
  req.user = {
    id: 1,
    department: 'admin',  // ← ALWAYS 'admin'!
    role: { level: 5, name: 'super_admin' }
  };
  return next();
}
```

**Impact:**
- When page refreshed, backend returned **mock admin user** instead of real authenticated user
- User's actual department was **ignored**
- App's `ProtectedDashboard` component detected department mismatch and redirected to admin dashboard

---

### 🟡 **Secondary Issue: JWT Token Expiration**

**Location:** `server/.env` (line 15)

**Problem:**
- JWT tokens expire after **24 hours**
- When token expires, API calls return **401 Unauthorized**
- Frontend axios interceptor (`client/src/utils/api.js`) automatically logs user out

**Impact:**
- Users logged out after 24 hours without warning
- Any API call after expiration triggered immediate logout and redirect to login page

---

## Solutions Applied

### ✅ **Fix 1: Removed Mock User Bypass**

**File:** `server/middleware/auth.js`

**Change:** Removed the development mode bypass that created a fake admin user

**Before:**
```javascript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && !req.path.startsWith('/api/auth/login')) {
  req.user = {
    id: 1,
    department: 'admin',
    role: { level: 5, name: 'super_admin' }
  };
  return next();
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Removed - Now uses real JWT authentication in all environments
```

**Result:** Backend now **always** uses real authenticated user data from JWT token

---

### ✅ **Fix 2: Improved Frontend Auth Handling**

**File:** `client/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`

**Changes:**
- Added explicit `setUser(null)` on auth failure
- Added comment to clarify we use backend user data
- Removed unnecessary 1-second delay

**Result:** User state properly syncs with backend data

---

### ✅ **Fix 3: Enhanced Token Expiration Handling**

**File:** `client/src/utils/api.js`

**Changes:**
- Added console warnings for debugging
- Prevents redirect loop on login/register pages
- Better error messages

**Result:** More graceful handling of expired tokens

## How Department Routing Works

### App Routing Logic (`client/src/App.jsx`)

```javascript
const ProtectedDashboard = ({ department, children }) => {
  if (!canAccessDepartment(department)) {
    // Redirect to user's own department if they can't access requested one
    return <Navigate to={`/${user.department}/dashboard`} replace />;
  }
  return children;
};
```

### Access Control (`client/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`)

```javascript
const canAccessDepartment = (department) => {
  if (!user) return false;
  
  // Admin (level 4+) can access all departments
  if (user.role && user.role.level >= 4) return true;
  
  // Regular users can only access their own department
  return user.department === department;
};
```

**Department Hierarchy:**
- **Level 5:** Super Admin - access to everything
- **Level 4:** Admin - access to all departments
- **Level 1-3:** Regular users - access only to their assigned department

## Testing the Fix

### ✅ **Test 1: Login with Different Departments**

1. Login as sales user: `sales@pashion.com` / `sales123`
2. Should redirect to: `/sales/dashboard`
3. Refresh page
4. Should stay on: `/sales/dashboard` ✅

### ✅ **Test 2: Cross-Department Access**

1. Login as sales user
2. Manually navigate to: `/admin/dashboard`
3. Should auto-redirect to: `/sales/dashboard` ✅

### ✅ **Test 3: Admin Access**

1. Login as admin: `admin@pashion.com` / `admin123`
2. Should redirect to: `/admin/dashboard`
3. Navigate to any department (sales, procurement, etc.)
4. Should allow access ✅ (admin can access all departments)

### ✅ **Test 4: Token Expiration**

- JWT tokens now last **24 hours**
- After expiration, user will be logged out with console warning
- Can adjust expiration in `server/.env`: `JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h`

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `server/middleware/auth.js` - Removed mock user bypass
2. ✅ `client/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx` - Improved auth state handling
3. ✅ `client/src/utils/api.js` - Enhanced 401 error handling

---

## Important Notes

### 🔐 **Authentication Flow**

1. User logs in → Backend generates JWT token with user data
2. Token stored in localStorage
3. Every API request includes token in Authorization header
4. Backend verifies token and returns real user data
5. Frontend uses user data for routing and permissions

### 🚨 **Common Pitfalls**

❌ **Don't** modify `user.department` on frontend
❌ **Don't** bypass authentication in production
❌ **Don't** use mock users in any environment
✅ **Do** always use real JWT tokens
✅ **Do** sync user state from backend
✅ **Do** handle token expiration gracefully

### 🔧 **Environment Variables**

```env
# server/.env
NODE_ENV=development          # Environment mode
JWT_SECRET=<your_secret>      # JWT signing key (keep secret!)
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h            # Token lifetime (24 hours default)
```

**To increase token lifetime:**
```env
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d   # 7 days
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=48h  # 48 hours
```

## Next Steps

### 🛠️ **To Apply the Fix:**

1. **Stop the development server** (Ctrl+C)
2. **Restart the server:**
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Clear browser localStorage** (optional but recommended):
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application → Local Storage
   - Delete `token` entry
4. **Login again** with your credentials
5. **Test the fixes** using the test scenarios above

---

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Check User Data in Browser Console

```javascript
// Open browser console (F12) and run:
JSON.parse(atob(localStorage.getItem('token').split('.')[1]))
// Shows: { userId, email, department, exp, iat }
```

### Check Backend Logs

```bash
# Server logs will show:
# "Auth check failed" - when token verification fails
# "Session expired - logging out" - when 401 received on frontend
```

---

## Status: ✅ FIXED

- ✅ Mock user bypass removed
- ✅ Real JWT authentication enforced
- ✅ Department routing working correctly
- ✅ Token expiration handled gracefully
- ✅ No more unexpected redirects
