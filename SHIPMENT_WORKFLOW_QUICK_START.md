  element: <ShipmentManagementPage />,
  requiredDepartment: ['manufacturing', 'shipment', 'admin']
}
```

### STEP 2: Add Navigation Menu (2 minutes)
**File:** `client/src/components/layout/Sidebar.js`

Find the Manufacturing section and add:

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Database:** Shipment tables already exist - no migrations needed
- **Auth:** Users need 'manufacturing' or 'shipment' or 'admin' department
- **Production Order:** Must be 100% completed before marking ready
- **Auto-numbering:** Shipment numbers auto-generate (SHP-YYYYMMDD-XXXX)
- **Notifications:** Framework ready, configure email service for customer alerts

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**"Mark as Ready for Shipment" button doesn't appear:**
- ✓ Check production order status is "completed"
- ✓ Check overall progress is 100%

**Shipment status update fails:**
- ✓ Check new status is valid for current status
- ✓ Check user has shipment department permission

**Shipment doesn't show up:**
