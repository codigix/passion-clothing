### Step 1: Open Manufacturing Dashboard
```
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000
2. Click: Manufacturing ‚Üí Dashboard (or navigate to /manufacturing/dashboard)
3. Look for: "Ready for Production" section with green "Start Production" buttons

### Step 2: Click Start Production Button
```
1. Find a sales order in "Ready for Production" section

### Step 3: Verify Auto-Fill
```
1. Check browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)

3. Wait a moment for data to load

```

**Expected:**
- Form fields are pre-filled:
  ```
  Step 1: Select Order
  - Sales Order ID: [FILLED]
  
  Step 2: Order Details
  - Product: [FILLED or auto-selected]
  - Quantity: [FILLED - e.g., "100"]
  - Customer Name: [FILLED - e.g., "ABC Corp"]
  - Project Reference: [FILLED - e.g., "SO-789"]
  
  Step 3: Scheduling

  ```

### Step 4: Complete the Wizard
```
1. Review the pre-filled information
2. Click "Next" to proceed through steps
3. Fill in required fields as needed:
   - Step 4: Materials (verify quantities)
   - Step 5: Quality (set checkpoints)
   - Step 6: Team (assign supervisor)
   - Step 7: Customization (keep default or customize)
   - Step 8: Review (verify all and submit)
4. Click "Submit" on final step
```

**Expected:**

- ‚úÖ Production order created
- ‚úÖ Redirected to success page or dashboard
- ‚úÖ New production order appears in "Active Production Orders"

### Step 5: Verify in Database (Optional)
```sql

SELECT 
  po.id,
  po.production_number,
  po.sales_order_id,
  so.order_number,
  po.project_reference,
  po.quantity
FROM ProductionOrder po
LEFT JOIN SalesOrder so ON po.sales_order_id = so.id
ORDER BY po.created_at DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

**Expected:**
- New row with your sales_order_id
- production_number starting with PRD-
- project_reference same as order_number
