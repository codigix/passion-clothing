## 📦 Backend Implementation

### 1. Database Models Created

**Location:** `server/models/`

| Model | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| MaterialDispatch | `MaterialDispatch.js` | Track materials dispatched from inventory |
| MaterialReceipt | `MaterialReceipt.js` | Track materials received in manufacturing |
| MaterialVerification | `MaterialVerification.js` | QC verification of received materials |
| ProductionApproval | `ProductionApproval.js` | Manager approval for production readiness |

**All models registered in:** `server/config/database.js`

### 2. Database Tables Created

**Migrations Location:** `server/migrations/`

| Migration File | Table | Foreign Keys |
|----------------|-------|--------------|
| `20250128000001-create-material-dispatch-table.js` | `material_dispatches` | → project_material_requests, users |
| `20250128000002-create-material-receipt-table.js` | `material_receipts` | → material_dispatches, project_material_requests, users |
| `20250128000003-create-material-verification-table.js` | `material_verifications` | → material_receipts, project_material_requests, users |
| `20250128000004-create-production-approval-table.js` | `production_approvals` | → material_verifications, project_material_requests, production_orders, users |

### 3. API Routes Created

**Location:** `server/routes/`

| Route File | Base URL | Endpoints |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| `materialDispatch.js` | `/api/material-dispatch` | POST /create, GET /:mrnId, GET /list/all, GET /pending |
| `materialReceipt.js` | `/api/material-receipt` | POST /create, GET /:dispatchId, GET /list/pending-verification, PUT /:id/discrepancy |

MaterialDispatch (1:1)
  ↓
MaterialReceipt (1:1)
  ↓
MaterialVerification (1:1)
  ↓

**Audit Trail:**
- Every stage linked via foreign keys
- Complete history preserved in database
- Can trace full lifecycle from MRN → Approval

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Step 1: Run Migrations

```bash
# Option A: Using migration script
node server/scripts/runMRNFlowMigrations.js

# Option B: Manual migrations
cd server
node -e "require('./migrations/20250128000001-create-material-dispatch-table').up(require('./config/database').sequelize.getQueryInterface(), require('sequelize'))"
node -e "require('./migrations/20250128000002-create-material-receipt-table').up(require('./config/database').sequelize.getQueryInterface(), require('sequelize'))"
node -e "require('./migrations/20250128000003-create-material-verification-table').up(require('./config/database').sequelize.getQueryInterface(), require('sequelize'))"
node -e "require('./migrations/20250128000004-create-production-approval-table').up(require('./config/database').sequelize.getQueryInterface(), require('sequelize'))"
```

### Step 2: Restart Server

```bash
# From project root
npm run dev

# Or server only
cd server
npm start
```

### Step 3: Update Frontend Routes

Add these routes to `client/src/App.js`:

```javascript
// Inventory Routes
<Route path="/inventory/dispatch/:mrnId" element={<StockDispatchPage />} />

// Manufacturing Routes
<Route path="/manufacturing/material-receipt/:dispatchId" element={<MaterialReceiptPage />} />
<Route path="/manufacturing/stock-verification/:receiptId" element={<StockVerificationPage />} />
<Route path="/manufacturing/production-approval/:verificationId" element={<ProductionApprovalPage />} />
```

### Step 4: Add Navigation Links

Update `MRMListPage.jsx` to add action buttons for each MRN based on status:

```javascript
// If status === 'stock_available' → Show "Dispatch" button → Navigate to /inventory/dispatch/:mrnId
// If status === 'materials_issued' → Show "Receive" button → Navigate to /manufacturing/material-receipt/:dispatchId
// If status === 'issued' → Show "Verify" button → Navigate to /manufacturing/stock-verification/:receiptId
// If status === 'materials_ready' → Show "Approve" button → Navigate to /manufacturing/production-approval/:verificationId
```

## 📊 Status Flow

### MRN Status Updates

| Stage | Old Status | Action | New Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Stock Dispatch | `stock_available` | Dispatch materials | `materials_issued` |
| Material Receipt | `materials_issued` | Receive (no issues) | `issued` |
| Material Receipt | `materials_issued` | Receive (with issues) | `partially_issued` |
| Stock Verification | `issued` | Verify & Pass | `materials_ready` |
| Stock Verification | `issued` | Verify & Fail | (stays `issued`) |
| Production Approval | `materials_ready` | Approve | `completed` |
| Production Approval | `materials_ready` | Reject | `cancelled` |

| Materials Received | Inventory (Dispatcher) | Medium | Receipt created (no discrepancy) |
| Discrepancy Found | Inventory (Dispatcher) | High | Receipt with discrepancy |
| Verification Passed | Manufacturing (MRN creator) | Medium | Verification passed |
| Verification Failed | Manufacturing (MRN creator) | High | Verification failed |
| Production Approved | Manufacturing (MRN creator) | High | Approval granted |
| Production Rejected | Manufacturing (MRN creator) | High | Approval rejected |

5. **Verify Materials** (Manufacturing QC)
   - Click "Verify" button on MRN
   - Check all QC points (Y/N)
   - Overall result: PASSED
   - Submit → Status: `materials_ready`

6. **Approve Production** (Manufacturing Manager)
   - Click "Approve" button on MRN
   - Review verification report
   - Select "Approved"
   - Set production start date
   - Submit → Status: `completed`

7. **Start Production** (Manufacturing)
