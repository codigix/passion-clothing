# Approved Productions Project-Wise Restructure - Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 What Changed?

**Before**: "Approved Productions Ready to Start" showed individual approvals in a flat table
```
Approval #  | Project | Materials | Actions
Appr-001    | SO-123  | Material1 | [Play] [View]
Appr-002    | SO-123  | Material2 | [Play] [View]  ← Same project!
```

**After**: Projects grouped with all their approvals in one card
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Project SO-123                  │
│ Customer: Acme                  │
│ [2 approvals] [5 materials]     │
│    [Play] Create Production Order│
│                                 │
│ • Approval 1: Appr-001          │
│ • Approval 2: Appr-002          │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🚀 How It Works (User Flow)

### Step 1: View Grouped Projects
1. Open **Manufacturing** → **Production Orders**
2. Scroll down to **"Approved Productions Ready to Start"**
3. See projects instead of individual approvals
   - Each project shows: SO number, approval count, material count, customer name

### Step 2: Click "Create Production Order"
1. Click the green **"Create Production Order"** button on a project card
2. Wizard opens automatically with project pre-loaded

### Step 3: Review Auto-Loaded Data
The wizard automatically:
- ✅ Loads sales order details
- ✅ Merges all materials from all approvals for the project
- ✅ Pre-fills customer name and dates
- ✅ Shows merged material list

### Step 4: Submit
1. Review the pre-filled data
2. Adjust dates if needed (others auto-filled)
3. Click **"Submit"**
4. Single production order created for entire project
5. All approvals automatically linked

## 🧪 Quick Test (2 minutes)

### Prerequisites
You need:
- ✅ 1 Sales Order (SO-1234)
- ✅ 2+ Material Approval Requests for same SO
- ✅ All approvals marked as "Approved"

### Test Steps

**Step 1: Check Grouping**
```
1. Go to Production Orders page
2. Find "Approved Productions Ready to Start"
3. Verify: See 1 PROJECT CARD (not 2 rows)
4. Verify: Card shows "2 approvals"
5. Verify: Badge shows "1 Project Ready (2 approvals)"
```

**Step 2: Check Auto-Load**
```
1. Click "Create Production Order"
2. Open Browser Console (F12)
3. Verify logs appear:
   ✅ "🚀 Loading project-wise approvals: ..."
   ✅ "✅ Loaded 2 approvals for project"
   ✅ "📦 Merged X materials → Y unique"
4. Verify toast: "✅ Loaded X materials from 2 approvals"
```

**Step 3: Check Material Merge**
```
1. Go to Materials step in wizard
2. Verify all materials from both approvals present
3. If both approvals had "Thread":
   - Old behavior: Thread appears twice
   - New behavior: Thread appears once with combined qty
```

**Step 4: Submit Order**
```
1. Fill dates if needed
2. Click Submit
3. Verify console shows:
   "🚀 Marking 2 approval(s) as production started..."
   "✅ Approval X marked as started" (appears 2x)
4. Verify toast: "Production order created successfully"
5. Verify new order in Production Orders list
```

## 🔍 Console Logs to Watch For

When testing, you'll see these console logs (Press F12 to open):

```javascript
// When clicking "Create Production Order"
🚀 Loading project-wise approvals: appr1,appr2,appr3

// When approvals loaded
✅ Loaded 3 approvals for project

// When merging materials
📦 Merged 8 materials → 5 unique items

// When submitting form
🚀 Marking 3 approval(s) as production started...
✅ Approval 1 marked as started
✅ Approval 2 marked as started
✅ Approval 3 marked as started
```

If you don't see these logs, something didn't work - check the troubleshooting section.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why doesn't it show projects if I only have 1 approval?**
A: Projects with 1 approval still show - they're grouped the same way. You just see "1 approval" in the badge.

**Q: What if approvals have different customers?**
A: The wizard uses the customer from the first approval's sales order. All approvals must be for same sales order.

**Q: Can I click "Create Order" on different projects separately?**
A: Yes! Each project is independent. Create multiple orders for different projects.

**Q: What happens to old individual approvals if I have many?**
A: They're all grouped by project. A project with 5 approvals shows as 1 card with "5 approvals".

**Q: Do materials get duplicated or merged?**
A: **Merged** - if Thread appears in Approval 1 and Approval 2, you get ONE Thread line with combined quantity.

**Q: Can I modify materials in the wizard?**
A: Yes - auto-loaded materials can still be edited like normal. You can add/remove items.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### ❌ Problem: Still showing individual approvals (not grouped)
- **Check**: Are you on the latest version?
- **Check**: Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)
- **Check**: Clear browser cache
- **Fix**: Restart development server

### ❌ Problem: "Create Production Order" button not visible
- **Check**: Are there approved productions? (Check badge)
- **Check**: Page scrolled down enough? Button is on project card header
- **Fix**: Refresh page, check for JS errors (F12 console)

### ❌ Problem: Materials not loading in wizard
- **Check**: Browser console for errors (F12)
- **Check**: "🚀 Loading project-wise approvals" log appears?
- **Check**: Internet connection ok?
- **Fix**: Check if backend `/production-approval/:id/details` endpoint works

### ❌ Problem: Materials appear twice instead of merged
- **Check**: Different material codes? (Thread vs ThreadX?)
- **Check**: Case sensitivity? (thread vs Thread?)
- **Fix**: Backend should use consistent material_code field

### ❌ Problem: Only one approval marked as started after submit
- **Check**: Console shows "Marking 1 approval" instead of "Marking 2"?
- **Check**: Both approvals visible in wizard form step?
- **Fix**: Check if `orderSelection.projectApprovalIds` is set correctly
