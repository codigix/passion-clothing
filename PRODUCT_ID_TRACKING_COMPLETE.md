## üìã Testing Checklist

After completing all steps, test the complete flow:

### Test Scenario: Create Order for "School Shirt"

```
Step 1: Create Sales Order
  ‚è≥ Select Product: "School Uniform Shirt - White - M"
  ‚è≥ Verify product_id saved in database
  
Step 2: Create Purchase Order
  ‚è≥ Verify product_id auto-filled from Sales Order
  ‚è≥ Check database: purchase_orders.product_id matches SO
  
Step 3: Create GRN
  ‚è≥ Verify product_id shown in form
  ‚è≥ Check database: goods_receipt_notes.product_id matches PO
  
Step 4: Verify GRN
  ‚è≥ See product info displayed
  ‚è≥ Verify product_id maintained
  
Step 5: Add to Inventory
  ‚è≥ Each inventory item has product_id
  
Step 6: Create MRN
  ‚è≥ Product info displayed
  ‚è≥ Check database: project_material_requests.product_id matches
  
Step 7: Dispatch Materials
  ‚è≥ Product info shown in dispatch
  ‚è≥ Check database: material_dispatches.product_id matches
  
Step 8: Receive Materials
  ‚è≥ Manufacturing sees product context
  ‚è≥ Check database: material_receipts.product_id matches
  
Step 9: Verify Materials
  ‚è≥ QC knows which product materials are for
  ‚è≥ Check database: material_verifications.product_id matches
  
Step 10: Approve Production
  ‚è≥ Manager sees product to be manufactured
  ‚è≥ Check database: production_approvals.product_id matches
  
Step 11: Start Production
  ‚è≥ Production Order has correct product_id
  ‚è≥ Can manufacture the right product
```

### Verification Query:

```sql
-- Trace product_id through entire workflow for Sales Order #1
SELECT 
  'Sales Order' as stage, 
  order_number as ref, 
  product_id, 
  product_name, 
  created_at 
FROM sales_orders 
WHERE id = 1

UNION ALL

SELECT 
  'Purchase Order', 
  po_number, 
  product_id, 
  product_name, 
  created_at 
FROM purchase_orders 
WHERE linked_sales_order_id = 1

UNION ALL

SELECT 
  'GRN', 
  grn_number, 
  product_id, 
  product_name, 
  received_date 
FROM goods_receipt_notes 
WHERE purchase_order_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM purchase_orders WHERE linked_sales_order_id = 1
)

UNION ALL

SELECT 
  'MRN', 
  request_number, 
  product_id, 
  product_name, 
  request_date 
FROM project_material_requests 
WHERE purchase_order_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM purchase_orders WHERE linked_sales_order_id = 1
)

UNION ALL

SELECT 
  'Material Dispatch', 
  dispatch_number, 
  product_id, 
  product_name, 
  dispatched_at 
FROM material_dispatches 
WHERE mrn_request_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM project_material_requests 
  WHERE purchase_order_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM purchase_orders WHERE linked_sales_order_id = 1
  )
)

ORDER BY created_at;
```

**Expected Result:** All rows should have the SAME product_id and product_name ‚úÖ

## üìä Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Complete Traceability** ‚úÖ
- Know which product each material is for
- Track materials from purchase to production
- Full audit trail maintained

### 2. **Better Reporting** ‚úÖ
```sql
-- Material cost by product
SELECT product_name, SUM(final_amount) 
FROM purchase_orders 
WHERE product_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY product_id, product_name;

-- Production orders by product
SELECT product_name, status, COUNT(*) 
FROM production_orders 
GROUP BY product_id, product_name, status;
```

### 3. **Accurate Costing** ‚úÖ
- Calculate exact material cost per product
- Track production cost per product
- Better pricing decisions

### 4. **Better Inventory Management** ‚úÖ
- Know which materials are for which products
- Prevent wrong material allocation
- Better stock planning

### 5. **Improved Production Planning** ‚úÖ
