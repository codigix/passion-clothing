# 🎯 Executive Summary: Approved Productions Status Fix

## Issue Reported
Project **SO-S0-20251016-0001** was displaying:
```
Status: 🟢 Ready to Start   ❌ WRONG
Button: ▶ Start Production  ❌ WRONG
```

But should display:
```
Status: 🟠 In Production    ✅ CORRECT
Button: 👁 View Production  ✅ CORRECT
```

---

## Root Cause
The frontend was not extracting two critical data fields (`sales_order_id` and `production_approval_id`) from the API response, preventing the status detection logic from working.

---

## Solution Implemented ✅

**File Modified:** `ProductionOrdersPage.jsx`  
**Lines Changed:** 201-203 (2 new fields)  
**Effort:** < 1 minute  
**Risk:** Zero (just adding fields)

```javascript
// Lines 202-203 ADDED:
sales_order_id: order.sales_order_id,
production_approval_id: order.production_approval_id
```
