5. Finishing                     → Status: pending/in_progress/completed
6. Quality Check                 → Status: pending/in_progress/completed
```

**Tracking:** ✅ All stages properly tracked in ProductionStage table

### Stage Status Values

```
Enum: 'pending', 'in_progress', 'completed', 'on_hold', 'skipped'

## 📈 PROJECT STATUS TRACKING

### For Project SO-S0-20251016-0001

**Before Fix:**
```
ProductionOrdersPage: 🟢 Ready to Start    ❌ WRONG
Button: ▶ Start Production                 ❌ WRONG
Reason: sales_order_id not extracted → cannot find linked orders
```

**After Fix:**
```
ProductionOrdersPage: 🟠 In Production     ✅ CORRECT
Button: 👁 View Production                 ✅ CORRECT
Reason: sales_order_id extracted → finds linked orders → shows correct status
```

## ⚠️ RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. Database Performance (Optional)
```sql
-- Add indexes for common queries
CREATE INDEX idx_production_order_sales_order 
ON production_orders(sales_order_id);

CREATE INDEX idx_production_approval_id 
ON production_orders(production_approval_id);
```

### 2. Caching (Optional)
- Consider caching GET /manufacturing/orders response
- Invalidate on POST/PATCH operations
- Reduces database load

### 3. Pagination (Optional)
```
GET /api/manufacturing/orders?page=1&limit=20&sort=created_at&order=desc
```

### 4. API Documentation
- Document all endpoints with required fields
- Specify response schemas
- Include error codes

---

## 🔐 DATA SECURITY

- [x] All endpoints require authentication
- [x] Department-based access control enforced
- [x] Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned data
- [x] Cascade delete prevents data inconsistency
- [x] Audit trail maintained for all changes

---

## 📞 QUICK SUPPORT

### If Status Still Shows Incorrectly

1. **Hard refresh:** Ctrl+F5
2. **Check fix applied:** ProductionOrdersPage.jsx lines 202-203
3. **Verify API:** Open DevTools → Network → /manufacturing/orders
   - Look for: `sales_order_id` and `production_approval_id`
4. **Check database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT sales_order_id, production_approval_id 
   FROM production_orders LIMIT 5;
   ```

### If Stages Don't Match Between Pages

1. **ProductionTrackingPage:** Check stage count
2. **Open DevTools:** Network → /manufacturing/orders/:id
3. **Count stages** in response
4. If stages present in API but not displayed:
   - Issue is frontend rendering
   - Check page code for display logic
5. If stages missing from API:
   - Issue is backend data
   - Check database directly
