# Production Operations View - Simplified Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the simplified Production Operations View with support for outsourcing (embroidery/printing) and material reconciliation (final stage).

## ‚ú® Key Features

### 1. **Simplified Stage Management**
- ‚úÖ Clean, minimal interface
- ‚úÖ Edit start date and end date with time
- ‚úÖ No complex substages or detailed operations
- ‚úÖ Quick action buttons: Start, Pause, Complete, Hold
- ‚úÖ Progress tracking across all stages
- ‚úÖ Stage-by-stage navigation

### 2. **Outsourcing Flow (Embroidery & Printing Stages)**

#### Supported Stages
- Embroidery
- Printing
- Screen Printing
- Washing

#### Work Type Selection
- **In-House**: Work done internally
- **Outsourced**: Work sent to external vendor

#### Outward Challan (Sending to Vendor)
When outsourcing, you can create an outward challan with:
- Vendor selection
- Quantity to send
- Expected return date
- Transport details (mode, vehicle number)
- Special instructions

**Process:**
1. Select work type as "Outsourced"
2. Click "Create Outward Challan"
3. Fill in vendor details and items
4. Submit - challan is created and stage marked as in-progress

#### Inward Challan (Receiving from Vendor)
After vendor completes work, record receipt with:
- Link to outward challan
- Received quantity
- Quality inspection notes
- Any discrepancies

**Process:**
1. Click "Create Inward Challan"
2. Select the corresponding outward challan
3. Enter received quantity
4. Add quality notes and discrepancies
5. Submit - inward challan created, outward challan marked complete

#### Challan Tracking
- All challans for the stage are displayed
- Shows challan number, type (outward/inward), and status
- Easy reference for audit trail

### 3. **Material Reconciliation (Final Stage)**

When you reach the final production stage, the system helps you:

#### Features
- Calculate actual material consumption
- Track wastage
- Identify leftover materials
- Automatically return leftovers to inventory

#### Process
1. **Open Reconciliation**: Click "Open Material Reconciliation" button
2. **Review Materials**: See all allocated materials with:
   - Allocated quantity
   - Current consumed quantity
   - Current wasted quantity
   - Calculated leftover
3. **Update Actuals**: Edit:
   - Actual consumed amount
   - Actual wasted amount
   - System auto-calculates leftover
4. **Submit**: Complete reconciliation
   - Leftover materials returned to inventory
   - Inventory quantities updated
   - Inventory movement records created

#### Example
```
Material: Cotton Fabric
- Allocated: 100 meters
- Consumed: 85 meters (editable)
- Wasted: 5 meters (editable)
- Leftover: 10 meters (auto-calculated)

After submission:
‚úì 10 meters returned to inventory
‚úì Inventory movement recorded
‚úì Material allocation updated
```

6. **Stage Order**: Maintain stage sequence for proper flow

## üîß Customization

### Add More Outsourcing Stages
Edit `isOutsourcingStage()` function:
```javascript
const isOutsourcingStage = (stageName) => {
  const outsourcingStages = [
    'embroidery', 
    'printing', 
    'screen_printing', 
    'washing',
    'dyeing',  // Add new stage
    'pleating' // Add new stage
  ];
  return outsourcingStages.some(stage => 
    stageName.toLowerCase().includes(stage)
  );
};
```

### Modify Reconciliation Logic
Edit `handleReconciliationSubmit()` to add custom business rules.

## üìû Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check backend logs for API errors
2. Verify permissions in user profile
3. Ensure vendors are created before outsourcing
4. Check material allocations before reconciliation
