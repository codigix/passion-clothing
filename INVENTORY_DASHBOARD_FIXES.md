# Inventory Dashboard API Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Endpoint: `/api/inventory/orders/incoming`
**Error:** `404 Not Found`

**Fix:** Added new endpoint to fetch approved Purchase Orders ready for inventory.

**Location:** `server/routes/inventory.js` (lines 397-439)

**What it does:**
- Fetches all Purchase Orders with status `approved`
- These are POs that have been approved but not yet received into inventory
- Includes vendor details and material requirements
- Returns formatted data for the dashboard's "Incoming Orders" tab

---

### 2. Server Error: `/api/inventory/movements/recent`
**Error:** `500 Internal Server Error`

**Root Cause:**
- Endpoint didn't handle empty inventory table
- Query would fail if no data existed

**Fix:** Enhanced endpoint with better error handling

**Location:** `server/routes/inventory.js` (lines 261-308)

**Improvements:**
- Checks if Inventory table has data before querying
- Returns empty array if no inventory exists
- Changed to LEFT JOIN (`required: false`) to handle missing product associations
- Added default values for null fields
- Enhanced error logging with stack traces

---

### 3. Categories Endpoint Bug
**Error:** Duplicate `include` statement causing Sequelize errors

**Fix:** Removed duplicate include and improved error handling

**Location:** `server/routes/inventory.js` (lines 311-355)

**Improvements:**
- Removed duplicate `include` statement
- Added empty data check
- Added `required: false` for LEFT JOIN
- Better error logging
