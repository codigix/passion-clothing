## 🔍 Troubleshooting (If Tests Fail)

### Issue 1: Still Getting 404 Error
```
❌ POST /api/production-approvals/create 404
```

**Solution**:
1. [ ] Clear browser cache: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
2. [ ] Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
3. [ ] Verify line 730 has: `'/production-approval/create'` (singular)
4. [ ] Restart frontend: Kill terminal and `npm start` again
5. [ ] Check file was saved: `View > Command Palette > Files: Revert File`

### Issue 2: "Cannot read property 'id' of undefined"
```
❌ TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of undefined
```

**Solution**:
1. [ ] Ensure Step 2 completed successfully

3. [ ] Refresh page: F5
4. [ ] Check backend logs for errors

### Issue 3: Modal Doesn't Open
```
❌ Modal not visible
```

**Solution**:
1. [ ] Check browser console for errors
2. [ ] Verify data is loading (check Network tab)
3. [ ] Try different browser
4. [ ] Clear browser cache

### Issue 4: Backend 500 Error
```
❌ POST /api/production-approval/create 500
```

**Solution**:
1. [ ] Check backend console logs

- Average response time for approval API
- Error rate (should be 0%)
- User feedback

### Alert Conditions
- [ ] More than 1 error in 1 hour → Investigate
- [ ] API response time > 2 seconds → Investigate
- [ ] More than 10% failure rate → Rollback
