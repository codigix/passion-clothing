## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: "No dispatches showing in Material Receipts"
- **Cause:** Materials not dispatched from inventory
- **Fix:** Complete STEP 4 (Dispatch Materials)

### Problem: "Can't find Stock Verification page after receipt"
- **Cause:** Auto-redirect not working OR receipt not created
- **Fix:**
  1. Check browser console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console)
  2. Manually navigate: `/manufacturing/stock-verification/{receiptId}`
  3. Get receiptId from database: `SELECT id FROM MaterialReceipts ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1`

### Problem: "Verification submitting but not appearing in API"
- **Cause:** Verification created but overall_result is 'failed' or approval_status is not 'pending'
- **Fix:** Ensure all QC checks pass (all "Yes")
- **SQL Check:**
```sql
SELECT id, verification_number, overall_result, approval_status 
FROM MaterialVerifications 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

### Problem: "Production Approvals not appearing"
- **Cause:** No verifications with passed status
- **Fix:** Complete STEP 6 with all checks passing

### Problem: "Login not working"
- **Cause:** User not in database, wrong password, or auth endpoint broken
- **Fix:**
  1. Check user exists: 
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email = 'your.email@example.com';
  ```
  2. Check auth endpoint: Test with Postman
  3. Check server console for errors
