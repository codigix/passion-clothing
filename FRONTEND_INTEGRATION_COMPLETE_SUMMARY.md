## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: "No materials found in inventory"**
**Cause:** Product table doesn't have matching records
**Solution:** 
```sql
-- Check if products exist
SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%Cotton%';

-- Create product if missing
INSERT INTO products (name, product_code, description) 
VALUES ('Cotton Fabric', 'COT-001', 'Cotton fabric material');
```

### **Issue 2: "GRN check shows false but GRN exists"**
**Cause:** GRN not approved or inventory not added
**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check GRN status
SELECT id, grn_number, verification_status, inventory_added 
FROM goods_receipt_notes 
WHERE purchase_order_id = 123;

-- Must have: verification_status = 'approved' AND inventory_added = true
```

### **Issue 3: "Stock shows 0 but items exist"**
**Cause:** `available_stock` is 0 (all reserved or consumed)
**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check inventory
SELECT id, item_name, current_stock, available_stock, reserved_stock 
FROM inventory 
WHERE item_name LIKE '%Cotton%';

-- Update if needed
UPDATE inventory 
SET available_stock = current_stock - reserved_stock 
WHERE id = 45;
```

### **Issue 4: "Dispatch not created"**
**Cause:** `force_dispatch` not set to true for partial stock
**Solution:** Click "Force Dispatch" button instead of "Auto Approve"

### **Issue 5: "Transaction rolled back"**
**Cause:** Database constraint violation or error in any step
**Solution:** Check server logs for detailed error:
```bash
# View server logs
tail -f server/server.log
```
