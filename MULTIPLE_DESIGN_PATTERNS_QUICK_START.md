## ⚡ Tips & Tricks

**Pro Tips:**
1. Upload all variations at once (multi-select file dialog)
2. Use descriptive names: `front_logo_v2.png` instead of `image.png`
3. Include both images and PDFs for complete documentation
4. Remove files by hovering and clicking trash icon
5. File counter shows total uploaded

**Do's:**
✅ Mix different file types (images + PDFs)
✅ Upload high-resolution pattern images
✅ Use clear, descriptive file names
✅ Include design specifications in PDF/DOC
✅ Update patterns if design changes

**Don'ts:**
❌ Exceed 5 file limit
❌ Upload files > 5MB each
❌ Use unsupported file types (requires images/PDF/DOC)
❌ Wait until submission to upload patterns
❌ Forget to remove outdated pattern versions
