# MRN Flow Navigation Fix - Quick Summary üöÄ

## What Was Broken

Users couldn't complete the MRN verification flow because after receiving materials, they were redirected back to the list instead of being sent to the QC verification page.

**Result:** Empty `{verifications: []}` - no verification records ever created.

## What's Fixed

‚úÖ **3 Critical Navigation Issues Fixed:**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Material Receipt Page
**File:** `client/src/pages/manufacturing/MaterialReceiptPage.jsx` (Line 118-128)

```javascript
// After creating receipt, now redirects to verification page:
navigate(`/manufacturing/stock-verification/${receiptId}`);
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Stock Verification Page  
**File:** `client/src/pages/manufacturing/StockVerificationPage.jsx` (Line 119-133)

```javascript
// After verification PASSED, now redirects to approval page:
if (overallResult === 'passed') {
  navigate(`/manufacturing/production-approval/${verificationId}`);
}
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Production Approval Page
**File:** `client/src/pages/manufacturing/ProductionApprovalPage.jsx` (Line 80)

```javascript
// Now uses correct route path:
navigate(`/manufacturing/wizard?approvalId=${approvalId}`);
```

## The Flow Now Works Like This

```
Receive Materials ‚úÖ
    ‚Üì
[AUTO] ‚Üí Stock Verification Page ‚úÖ
    ‚Üì
Complete QC Verification ‚úÖ
    ‚Üì
[AUTO] ‚Üí Production Approval Page ‚úÖ
    ‚Üì
Approve Materials ‚úÖ
    ‚Üì
[AUTO] ‚Üí Production Wizard ‚úÖ
    ‚Üì
Create Production Order ‚úÖ
```

## How to Test

### Quick Manual Test (5 minutes)
1. Create MRN Request ‚Üí Dispatch ‚Üí Receive Materials
2. ‚úÖ Should redirect to **Stock Verification** (NEW!)
3. Complete verification checks ‚Üí Submit
4. ‚úÖ Should redirect to **Production Approval** (NEW!)
5. Approve materials ‚Üí Submit
6. ‚úÖ Should redirect to **Production Wizard** (NEW!)

### Automated Test
```powershell
cd "d:\projects\passion-clothing"
.\test-mrn-flow-fixed.ps1
```

### Database Check
```sql
-- Check if verifications are now being created
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM MaterialVerifications;
-- Should be > 0 if you've completed verifications

-- Check if approvals are now being created
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ProductionApprovals;
-- Should be > 0 if you've approved materials
```
