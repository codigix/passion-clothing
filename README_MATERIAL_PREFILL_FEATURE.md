## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

```
User selects Sales Order
    ↓
Auto-fetch hook detects change
    ↓
Extract project name
    ↓
Call: GET /manufacturing/project/{projectName}/mrn-materials
    ↓
Backend queries MRN + enriches with inventory
    ↓
Return enriched materials
    ↓
Frontend transforms to form format
    ↓
Set form values via react-hook-form
    ↓
MaterialsStep re-renders with data
    ↓
User sees complete material information
```

### Material Enrichment

Each material gets enhanced with:
- Batch number (from inventory)
- Warehouse location (from inventory)
- Rack number (from inventory)
- Category & material type (from inventory)
- Color information (from inventory)
- Stock availability (from inventory)
