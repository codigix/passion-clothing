# Production Wizard Material Validation & Pre-filling Fix

## 🎯 Overview
Enhanced the Production Wizard to properly validate and pre-fill materials from Material Receipt records. This ensures that production orders are created using the **actual materials that were dispatched from inventory and received in manufacturing** for that specific project.

---

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Backend Enhancement (`server/routes/productionApproval/productionApproval.js`)

#### **Issue:**
- Production approval details endpoint was not including dispatch information
- Missing link between received materials and their dispatch records

#### **Fix:**
```javascript
// Added dispatch data to the production approval details endpoint
include: [
  {
    model: db.MaterialReceipt,
    as: 'receipt',
    attributes: ['id', 'receipt_number', 'received_materials', 'total_items_received', 'project_name', 'dispatch_id'],
    include: [
      {
        model: db.MaterialDispatch,
        as: 'dispatch',
        attributes: ['id', 'dispatch_number', 'dispatched_materials', 'project_name']
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Benefits:**
- Complete traceability from dispatch → receipt → production
- Access to both dispatched and received material data
- Project validation across the entire flow

---

### 2. Frontend Material Mapping (`client/src/pages/manufacturing/ProductionWizardPage.jsx`)

#### **Issue:**
- Incorrect field mapping from `received_materials` structure
- Looking for wrong field names (`inventory_id`, `name`, `quantity`)
- No fallback to requested materials if receipt not available
- No validation feedback for users

#### **Fix:**

**Correct Field Mapping:**
```javascript
// Material Receipt Structure:
{
  material_name: "Cotton Fabric",
  material_code: "FAB-001",
  quantity_dispatched: 100,
  quantity_received: 98,
  uom: "meters",
  barcode_scanned: "BAR123456",
  condition: "Good",
  remarks: "2 meters damaged"
}

// Correctly mapped to form fields:
{
  materialId: m.inventory_id || m.material_code || m.barcode_scanned,
  description: m.material_name || m.name || m.description,
  requiredQuantity: m.quantity_received || m.quantity || m.quantity_dispatched,
  unit: m.uom || m.unit,
  status: 'available',
  condition: m.condition,
  barcode: m.barcode_scanned || m.barcode,
  remarks: m.remarks
}
```

**Fallback Logic:**
```javascript
if (receivedMaterials && receivedMaterials.length > 0) {
  // Use received materials (preferred)
  toast.success(`✅ ${receivedMaterials.length} material(s) loaded from receipt`);
} else if (materialsRequested && materialsRequested.length > 0) {
  // Fallback to requested materials
  toast.info(`⚠️ Using requested materials - receipt not yet received`);
}
```

### 3. MaterialsStep Component Enhancement

#### **New Features:**

**1. Visual Indicator for Auto-filled Materials:**
```jsx
<div className="bg-green-50 border border-green-200 rounded-lg p-4">
  <CheckCircle2 className="h-5 w-5 text-green-600" />
  <p className="text-sm font-medium text-green-900">
    Materials loaded from approved receipt
  </p>
  <p className="text-xs text-green-700 mt-1">
    These materials were dispatched from inventory and received in manufacturing. 
    Verify quantities and add any additional materials if needed.
  </p>
</div>
```

**2. Additional Material Fields:**
- **Barcode:** Shows scanned barcode from receipt (read-only)
- **Condition:** Material condition at receipt (read-only)
- **Remarks:** Any notes from receipt (read-only)

**3. Better Labels:**
- Changed "Material" to "Material ID / Code" for clarity
- Added tooltips explaining field purposes

## 📊 Data Flow

### Complete Material Flow:

```
1. Sales Order Created
   ↓
2. Material Request (MRN) Created
   └─ materials_requested (JSON)
   ↓
3. Materials Dispatched from Inventory
   └─ dispatched_materials (JSON)
      - material_name, material_code
      - quantity_dispatched, uom
      - barcode, batch_number, location
   ↓
4. Materials Received in Manufacturing
   └─ received_materials (JSON)
      - material_name, material_code
      - quantity_dispatched, quantity_received
      - uom, barcode_scanned
      - condition, remarks
   ↓
5. QC Verification
   └─ verification_result (approved/rejected)
   ↓
6. Production Approval
   └─ approval_status (approved)
   ↓
7. Production Wizard ✨ (YOU ARE HERE)
   └─ Auto-fills materials from received_materials
   └─ Validates against actual received quantities
   └─ Shows material condition and remarks
   ↓
8. Production Order Created
   └─ Links to materials from step 4
```

## ✅ Validation Checks

### 1. **Material Source Validation**
- ✅ Materials must come from an approved production approval
- ✅ Materials must have been received (not just requested)
- ✅ Project name must match across dispatch → receipt → approval

### 2. **Quantity Validation**
- ✅ Uses `quantity_received` (actual) not `quantity_dispatched` (planned)
- ✅ Shows discrepancies if any (via condition/remarks fields)
- ✅ Allows manual adjustment if needed

### 3. **Traceability**
- ✅ Links to dispatch ID
- ✅ Links to receipt ID
- ✅ Links to approval ID
- ✅ Barcode tracking throughout

## 🚀 Testing Guide

### Test Scenario 1: Happy Path
1. Create Sales Order
2. Create Material Request (MRN)
3. Dispatch materials from Inventory
4. Receive materials in Manufacturing
5. Complete QC Verification
6. Approve Production
7. Navigate to Production Wizard with `?approvalId=X`
8. **Expected:** Materials auto-fill with correct quantities, condition, and barcodes

### Test Scenario 2: Partial Receipt
1. Follow steps 1-3 above
2. Receive materials with discrepancy (e.g., 98 received, 100 dispatched)
3. Complete verification with notes
4. Approve Production
5. Navigate to Production Wizard
6. **Expected:** 
   - Quantity shows 98 (received, not 100)
   - Remarks show discrepancy notes
   - Condition shows material state

### Test Scenario 3: Fallback to Requested Materials
1. Create Sales Order
2. Create Material Request (MRN)
3. **Skip dispatch/receipt steps**
4. Navigate to Production Wizard with `?approvalId=X`
5. **Expected:**
   - Materials show from `materials_requested`
   - Status shows "ordered" (not "available")
   - Warning toast: "Using requested materials - receipt not yet received"
