# Stock Dispatch - Inventory Linking Fix

## Problem Summary
When dispatching materials from the Stock Dispatch Page, materials were not linked to inventory items, causing:
- **500 Internal Server Error** on dispatch
- **Warning**: "material(s) don't have inventory_id"
- **Issue**: Stock quantities were not being deducted from inventory

## Root Cause
Materials in Material Request Notes (MRN) were not automatically linked to inventory items. The `inventory_id` field was missing, so the system couldn't track which inventory items to deduct stock from.

## Solution Implemented

### Enhanced StockDispatchPage Features

#### 1. **Inventory Search & Link**
- Added "Link to Stock" button for each material
- Searches inventory based on material name
- Shows available inventory items with stock levels
- One-click linking to inventory items

#### 2. **Visual Indicators**
- 🟡 **Yellow background**: Materials not linked to inventory
- 🟢 **Green "Linked" badge**: Materials successfully linked
- ⚠️ **Warning banner**: Alert when materials are unlinked

#### 3. **Stock Availability Display**
- Shows available stock quantity for linked materials
- Color-coded: 
  - Green if sufficient stock
  - Red if insufficient stock

#### 4. **Enhanced Validation**
- **Blocks dispatch** if insufficient stock
- **Prompts confirmation** if materials are unlinked
- Clear error messages for validation failures

## How to Use

### Step 1: Navigate to Stock Dispatch
1. Go to Inventory → Material Requests
2. Click "Dispatch" on a pending MRN request

### Step 2: Link Materials to Inventory
1. For each material, click **"Link to Stock"** button
2. System searches inventory for matching items
3. Select the correct inventory item from the list
4. Material is now linked (shows green "Linked" badge)

### Step 3: Verify Stock & Quantities
1. Check the "Available" column shows stock quantity
2. Adjust "Dispatch Qty" if needed (max = available stock)
3. Verify barcode, batch number, and location auto-filled

### Step 4: Complete Dispatch
1. Add dispatch notes (optional)
2. Upload photos (optional)
3. Click **"Dispatch Materials"**
4. If materials are unlinked, confirm to proceed

## Technical Changes

### Frontend (client/src/pages/inventory/StockDispatchPage.jsx)

#### New State Variables
```javascript
const [searchingInventory, setSearchingInventory] = useState({});
const [inventoryResults, setInventoryResults] = useState({});
```

#### New Functions
- `searchInventoryForMaterial(index, materialName)` - Searches inventory
- `linkInventoryItem(materialIndex, inventoryItem)` - Links material to inventory

#### Enhanced Material Structure
```javascript
{
  material_name: string,
  material_code: string,
  quantity_requested: number,
  quantity_dispatched: number,
  uom: string,
  barcode: string,
  batch_number: string,
  location: string,
  inventory_id: number | null,          // NEW - Link to inventory
  available_stock: number | undefined,  // NEW - Available stock
  linked_item_name: string | undefined  // NEW - Linked item name
}
```

#### Enhanced Table Columns
- Added "Inventory Link" column with search/link functionality
- Added "Available" column showing stock levels
- Added expandable search results row
- Added warning banner for unlinked materials

#### Enhanced Validation
```javascript
// Check insufficient stock
const insufficientStock = dispatchedMaterials.filter(m => 
  m.inventory_id && 
  m.available_stock !== undefined && 
  m.quantity_dispatched > m.available_stock
);

// Confirmation for unlinked materials
const confirmed = window.confirm(...);
```

### Backend (No Changes Required)
The server already handled missing `inventory_id` gracefully:
- Skips inventory movement creation if `inventory_id` is null
- Logs warning: "Skipping inventory movement - no inventory_id"
- Continues dispatch without errors

## API Endpoint Used

### GET /api/inventory-enhanced
**Purpose**: Search inventory items

**Query Parameters**:
- `search` - Search term (material name)
- `limit` - Max results (default: 10)

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "inventory": [
    {
      "id": 123,
      "product_name": "Cotton Fabric",
      "product_code": "CTN-001",
      "current_stock": 500,
      "quantity": 500,
      "uom": "MTR",
      "location": "Warehouse A-1",
      "barcode": "INV1234567890",
      "batch_number": "B2025-001"
    }
  ]
}
```

## User Benefits

### For Inventory Managers
✅ **Accurate stock tracking** - Stock automatically deducted  
✅ **Visual confirmation** - See which materials are linked  
✅ **Prevent errors** - Validation prevents insufficient stock dispatch  
✅ **Audit trail** - All dispatches linked to specific inventory items

### For Manufacturing
✅ **Correct materials** - Receive materials from verified inventory  
✅ **Barcode tracking** - Each material has proper barcode  
✅ **Location info** - Know where materials came from

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. No Inventory Items Found
- Shows error toast: "No inventory items found for..."
- User can manually enter material details
- Proceed with confirmation

### 2. Insufficient Stock
- **Blocks dispatch** with error message
- User must reduce quantity or link to different inventory item

### 3. Multiple Matching Inventory Items
- Shows all matches in dropdown
- User selects the correct one
- Shows details: stock level, location, batch number

### 4. Materials Already Have inventory_id
- Shows "Linked" badge immediately
- No search required
- Can still dispatch normally

## Testing Checklist
