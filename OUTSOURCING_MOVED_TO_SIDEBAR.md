# Outsourcing Moved to Sidebar Navigation

## 📋 Overview

The **Outsourcing** feature has been moved from a Manufacturing Dashboard tab to a dedicated page accessible via the Manufacturing sidebar menu. This change improves navigation consistency and aligns with the pattern where action-oriented features (like Production Orders, Production Tracking, Quality Control) have dedicated pages rather than being embedded as dashboard tabs.

**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## 🎯 What Changed

### 1. **Manufacturing Sidebar - Added Outsourcing Link**

**File**: `client/src/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx`

Added "Outsourcing" menu item to the Manufacturing department menu:

```javascript
manufacturing: [
  { text: 'Dashboard', icon: <LayoutDashboard size={18} />, path: '/manufacturing' },
  { text: 'Production Wizard', icon: <Wand2 size={18} />, path: '/manufacturing/wizard', highlight: true },
  { text: 'Production Orders', icon: <Factory size={18} />, path: '/manufacturing/orders' },
  { text: 'Production Tracking', icon: <Clock size={18} />, path: '/manufacturing/tracking' },
  { text: 'Material Requests (MRN)', icon: <Send size={18} />, path: '/manufacturing/material-requests' },
  { text: 'Quality Control', icon: <Microscope size={18} />, path: '/manufacturing/quality' },
  { text: 'Outsourcing', icon: <Truck size={18} />, path: '/outsourcing' },  // ← NEW
  { text: 'Reports', icon: <FileText size={18} />, path: '/manufacturing/reports' },
]
```

**Icon**: `Truck` (Lucide icon representing transportation/vendor operations)

### 2. **Manufacturing Dashboard - Removed Outsourcing Tab**

**File**: `client/src/pages/dashboards/ManufacturingDashboard.jsx`
