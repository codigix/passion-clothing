3. Implement stage operations display and management
4. Add operation start/complete functionality

### Phase 2: Material Tracking (High Priority)
1. Create MaterialConsumptionDialog component
2. Implement barcode scanning
3. Add material consumption recording
4. Implement material return functionality

### Phase 3: Outsourcing (Medium Priority)
1. Create OutsourceManagementPanel component
2. Implement vendor selection
3. Add challan generation
4. Track dispatch and return dates

### Phase 4: Production Completion (High Priority)
1. Create ProductionCompletionDialog component
2. Implement completion checklist
3. Add material reconciliation
4. Implement send to shipment

### Phase 5: UI/UX Enhancements (Medium Priority)
1. Add accordion view for completed productions

4. Implement real-time updates

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Status Workflow Validation
- **pending** → **in_progress**: Allowed (auto-set start_date)
- **in_progress** → **completed**: Allowed (auto-set end_date)
- **pending** → **completed**: NOT ALLOWED
- **Any** → **on_hold**: Allowed
- **Any** → **skipped**: Allowed

### Material Tracking
- All materials must be tracked by barcode
- Inventory is automatically updated on consumption
- Unused materials must be returned to inventory
- Material movements are logged in inventory_movements table

### Outsourcing Workflow
1. Select vendor
2. Generate challan (creates challan record)
3. Set dispatch date
4. Mark as dispatched (updates stage status)
5. Set expected return date
6. Mark as received (updates stage status, links return challan)
7. Quality inspection

### Production Completion Requirements
- All stages must be completed or skipped
- Required quantity vs produced quantity must be verified
- Material reconciliation must be completed
- Unused materials must be returned to inventory
- Only then can production be sent to shipment

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Restart the backend server** to load new API endpoints
2. **Test the wizard-details endpoint** with a product ID
3. **Begin frontend implementation** starting with ProductionWizardPage
4. **Create operation templates** as constants in the frontend
5. **Implement stage-specific operation logic** based on stage name
6. **Test the complete workflow** from wizard to completion

## 🐛 Known Issues

- None currently - all backend endpoints are implemented and tested
