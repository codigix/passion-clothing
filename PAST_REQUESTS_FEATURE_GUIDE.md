# Past Orders/Requests Feature - Material Requirements Page

## Overview
Added a comprehensive "Past Orders/Requests" section to the Material Requirements (MRN) page that displays completed, fulfilled, rejected, or cancelled requests with their specific status and details.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Separation of Active vs Past Requests**
- Active requests: `pending`, `approved`, `in_progress`, `pending_inventory_review`
- Past requests: `fulfilled`, `completed`, `rejected`, `cancelled`, `partially_fulfilled`
- Automatic categorization based on request status
- Real-time count of active and past requests in stats

### 2. **Active Requests Section**
- Displays all currently active material requests
- Shows request count: "Active Requests (X)"
- Available in both Table and Card view modes
- Filter and search functionality applies to active requests by default
- Includes all material details: quantity, unit, created date, status badges

### 3. **Past Orders/Requests Section**
- **Location**: Below Active Requests section
- **Only Shows If**: There are completed/fulfilled/rejected/cancelled requests
- **Toggle Feature**: "Show/Hide Past Requests" button
  - Collapsed by default to reduce clutter
  - Expandable when needed
  - Visual feedback with arrow indicators (▶/▼)
  - Color-coded toggle buttons (gray when hidden, darker when visible)
- **Badge**: Clearly indicates "Completed, Fulfilled, Rejected, or Cancelled"
- **Count**: Shows total number of past requests in header

### 4. **Past Requests Display Options**

#### Table View
- Complete table with gray background to distinguish from active requests
- Columns:
  - Request Number
  - Material Name
  - Project Name
  - Quantity Requested
  - Unit
  - Issued Quantity
  - Final Status (with color-coded badge)
  - Created Date
  - Actions (View button)
- Row hover effect for better UX
- Lighter text color to indicate archived status

#### Card View
- Grid layout (2 columns on desktop)
- Visual distinction:
  - Gray gradient header background
  - Left border in gray (vs. purple for active)
  - Slightly reduced opacity (85%) when not hovered
  - Increases to full opacity on hover
- Displays:
  - Request number and creation date
  - Status and priority badges
  - Material name
  - Project name
  - Quantity details (requested and issued)
  - Status color-coded indicator box
  - View Details button

### 5. **Status Indicators**
Each request shows status with:
- **Visual Icon**: Checkmark (fulfilled), X (rejected/cancelled), clock (pending)
- **Color Badge**: Green (fulfilled), Red (rejected/cancelled), Yellow (pending)
- **Text Label**: Human-readable status (e.g., "FULFILLED", "CANCELLED")

### 6. **Summary Statistics**
New stats added:
```javascript
stats.active    // Count of active requests
stats.past      // Count of past requests
```

### 7. **View Details Navigation**
- Each past request has a "View Details" button
- Links to the request details page for reviewing full information
- Maintains all filtering context when returning to list

## User Experience Flow

### Step 1: Page Load
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Material Requirements (MRN)         │
│ Statistics Cards                    │
│ Search & Filter Controls            │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Active Requests (12)                │ ← Visible by default
│ [Table/Card View with Active Items] │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Past Orders/Requests (5)    ▶ SHOW  │ ← Collapsed by default
│ [Hidden until toggled]              │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 2: User Toggles Past Requests
```
Click "▶ SHOW" button
          ↓
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Past Orders/Requests (5)    ▼ HIDE  │
│ [Table/Card View with Past Items]   │ ← Now visible
│ - All items have gray styling       │
│ - Status clearly shown              │
│ - Can still view details            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Code Changes

### New State Variable
```javascript
const [showPastRequests, setShowPastRequests] = useState(false);
```

### Helper Function
```javascript
const isCompletedStatus = (status) => {
  return ['fulfilled', 'completed', 'rejected', 'cancelled', 'partially_fulfilled'].includes(status);
};
```

### Request Separation
```javascript
const activeRequests = filteredRequests.filter(r => !isCompletedStatus(r.status));
const pastRequests = filteredRequests.filter(r => isCompletedStatus(r.status));
```

### Updated Statistics
```javascript
const stats = {
  // ... existing stats
  active: activeRequests.length,
  past: pastRequests.length
};
```

## Visual Design

### Active Requests Section
- **Header**: Blue icon (FaClipboardList), dark text
- **Table Background**: White with standard row hover
- **Cards**: Purple gradient headers, purple left border

### Past Requests Section
- **Header**: Gray icon (FaWarehouse), darker text
- **Toggle Button**: 
  - Hidden: Gray background with arrow ▶
  - Visible: Dark gray background with arrow ▼
- **Table Background**: Gray (bg-gray-50)
- **Cards**: 
  - Gray gradient headers
  - Gray left border
  - Reduced opacity (85%) for visual de-emphasis
  - Full opacity on hover for readability

## Search & Filter Behavior

- **Search**: Applies to both active and past requests
- **Status Filter**: Works across both sections
  - Filter to "fulfilled" → Shows past requests matching fulfilled
  - Filter to "pending" → Shows active requests matching pending
- **Priority Filter**: Works across both sections
- **Project Filter**: Works across both sections
- **Reset Filters**: Clears all filters, shows all active by default

### Example Scenario
1. User filters by Status = "fulfilled"
2. Past Requests section expands automatically (if any results)
3. Only fulfilled requests shown in Past Requests table
4. Active Requests section shows "No Active Requests" (as they're not fulfilled)

## Statistics & Counting

The summary statistics at the top always show:
```
Total Requests   = Active + Past
Pending          = Only from active requests
Approved         = Only from active requests
Fulfilled        = Count from all (active + past)
Urgent Priority  = Count from all (active + past)
Active           = Count of non-completed requests
Past             = Count of completed/fulfilled/rejected/cancelled
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Past Requests hidden by default (collapsed)
- **Same Data Source**: Uses filteredRequests (already filtered)
- **No Additional API Calls**: Separates existing data
- **Memory Efficient**: Only renders visible section

## Browser Compatibility

- ✅ All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- ✅ Mobile responsive (cards collapse to single column)
- ✅ Tablet view (2 columns for cards)
- ✅ Desktop view (2 columns for cards)

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Tablet/Mobile View
```
┌──────────────────┐
│ Active Requests  │
│ (Single column)  │
├──────────────────┤
│ Past Requests ▶  │
│ [Collapsed]      │
└──────────────────┘
```

### When Past Requests Toggled on Mobile
```
┌──────────────────┐
│ [Card 1]         │
│ [Card 2]         │
│ [Card 3]         │
└──────────────────┘
```

## Icons Used

- **FaWarehouse** (Gray): Represents past/archived requests
- **FaClipboardList** (Blue): Represents active/current requests
- **FaArrowRight**: In View Details button
- **Status Icons** (inherited from existing code):
  - ✓ FaCheckCircle (Green) - Fulfilled
  - ✗ FaExclamationTriangle (Red) - Rejected/Cancelled
  - ⏱ FaClock (Blue) - Pending

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements
1. **Archive/Restore**: Allow moving requests back from past

7. **Comparison**: Compare active vs past request metrics
8. **Analytics**: Show trends in fulfilled vs rejected rates
9. **Retention Policy**: Archive requests older than X months

## Troubleshooting

### Past Requests Section Not Showing
- **Check**: Are there any completed/fulfilled/rejected/cancelled requests?
- **Solution**: Create test data with different statuses

### Toggle Not Working
- **Check**: Browser console for JavaScript errors
- **Check**: State variable `showPastRequests` is being updated
- **Solution**: Clear browser cache and reload

### Styling Issues
- **Check**: Tailwind CSS is properly loaded
- **Check**: No CSS conflicts with existing styles
- **Solution**: Verify imported icon components (FaWarehouse)

### Filter Not Working with Past Requests
- **Check**: The filter is applying to `filteredRequests`
- **Check**: Status values match the database values
- **Solution**: Debug console.log to verify status values
