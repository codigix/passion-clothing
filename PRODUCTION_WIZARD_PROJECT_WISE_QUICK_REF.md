## Quick Test (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Open Wizard
```
Go to: /manufacturing/wizard
```

### Step 2: Check Order Selection
```
✅ See projects as expandable cards (NOT flat list)
✅ Each project shows:
   - SO number (e.g., "SO-001")
   - Customer name
   - Approval count badge (e.g., "2 approvals")
   - Material count badge (e.g., "45 materials")
```

### Step 3: Expand a Project
```
Click any project card
✅ Expands to show all approvals
✅ Shows Approval #ID with receipt number
✅ First approval auto-selected (highlighted in blue)
```

### Step 4: Select Different Approval
```
Click different approval in same project
✅ Highlight moves to selected approval
✅ Form field updates with approval ID
```

### Step 5: Load Details
```
Click "Load Order Details" button
✅ Button shows "Loading..." with spinner
✅ Form fields pre-fill
✅ Console shows: "✅ Auto-filled form"
```

### Step 6: Check Console Logs
```
Press F12 → Console tab
Look for:
✅ "✅ Grouped X approvals into Y projects"
✅ "🚀 Project selected: SO-XXX"
✅ "✅ Approval selected: 42"
```

## Key Features

### 1. **Project Grouping**
```
Projects with Approvals section shows:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📦 SO-001234                           ▾        │
│ 👤 ABC Company  • 2 approvals • 50 materials   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. **Expandable Approvals**
```
Click to expand ▾
  ├─ Approval #42 • Receipt: RCP-001 • 25 items ✓ Selected
  └─ Approval #43 • Receipt: RCP-002 • 25 items
```

### 3. **One-Click Selection**
```
Click approval → instantly selects and highlights
No need for separate "Load" button for selection
```

### 4. **Material Merging** (from ProductionOrdersPage)
```
When accessing from ProductionOrdersPage:
URL: /manufacturing/wizard?projectApprovals=42,43&salesOrderId=5

✅ Auto-fetches both approvals
✅ Merges materials (no duplicates)
✅ Pre-fills entire form
✅ User skips to scheduling step
```

1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
2. Check Network tab for API errors
3. Look for error logs in console

### Issue: Approval not selected when clicking
**Solution**:
1. Make sure you're clicking the approval button
2. Not the project header

- **After**: O(1) project lookup with grouping
- **Performance**: Negligible impact
- **Memory**: Slightly higher (stores both grouped + flat)
- **Load Time**: Same (same API calls)

---

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully Compatible**:
- Old `?approvalId=123` flow still works
- Old flat approval list still in memory

## FAQ

**Q: Why did the dropdown change?**  
A: To match ProductionOrdersPage's project-wise grouping and make it clear which approvals belong to same project.

**Q: Do I lose the old flat view?**  
A: No, backward compatible. Old flows still work via URL parameter.

**Q: Can I select multiple projects?**  
A: Not yet, planned for future. Currently one project at a time.

**Q: What if project has 100 approvals?**  
A: List is scrollable with max-height. Good UX even with many items.

**Q: Does material merging happen automatically?**  
A: Yes, when coming from ProductionOrdersPage. Manual selection doesn't auto-merge yet.

**Q: Can I search for projects?**  
A: Not yet, planned enhancement for v2.
