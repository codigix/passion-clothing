# Operations Auto-Creation Implementation

## Problem
When production orders were created, stages were being generated but **no operations were being created** for those stages. This meant that when users opened the production tracking view, they saw empty stages with no operations to track.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Operations Creation** ‚úÖ
**File**: `server/routes/manufacturing.js` (Lines 577-596)

When a production order is created, operations are now automatically generated for each stage:

```javascript
// Create operations for each stage
for (const stage of createdStages) {
  try {
    const operations = await createOperationsForStage(
      stage.id,
      stage.stage_name,
      StageOperation,
      {
        outsourced: stage.outsourced,
        vendor_id: stage.vendor_id,
        is_printing: stage.is_printing,
        is_embroidery: stage.is_embroidery
      }
    );
    console.log(`Created ${operations.length} operations for stage: ${stage.stage_name} (outsourced: ${stage.outsourced})`);
  } catch (opError) {
    console.error(`Failed to create operations for stage ${stage.stage_name}:`, opError);
    // Continue with other stages even if one fails
  }
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced Stage Name Mapping** ‚úÖ
**File**: `server/utils/stageTemplates.js` (Lines 256-283)

Added intelligent stage name mapping to handle variations:

```javascript
const nameMapping = {
  'calculate_material_review': 'material_calculation',
  'material_review': 'material_calculation',
  'embroidery_or_printing': 'embroidery_printing',
  'embroidery/printing': 'embroidery_printing',
  'quality_check': 'quality_control',
  // ... and more
};
```

This ensures that regardless of how the stage name is formatted, the correct operations template is used.

### 3. **Separate Templates for Outsourced vs In-House** ‚úÖ
**File**: `server/utils/stageTemplates.js` (Lines 71-144)

Created two different operation templates for embroidery/printing:

#### **Outsourced Operations** (Default for Embroidery/Printing):
1. Design Selection
2. Prepare Work Order
3. **Send to Vendor** (marked as outsourced)
4. **Track Vendor Progress** (marked as outsourced)
5. **Receive from Vendor** (marked as outsourced)
6. Quality Inspection

#### **In-House Operations** (When outsourced = false):
1. Design Selection
2. Prepare Machine Setup
3. Test Run
4. Production Run
5. Drying/Curing
6. Quality Inspection

### 4. **Smart Template Selection** ‚úÖ
**File**: `server/utils/stageTemplates.js` (Lines 322-355)

The `createOperationsForStage` function now:
- Accepts stage data including `outsourced` flag
- Automatically detects embroidery/printing stages
- Selects the appropriate template (outsourced vs in-house)
- Sets vendor_id on operations when applicable

```javascript
// For embroidery/printing stages, check if outsourced
const isEmbroideryPrinting = normalizedName.includes('embroidery') || normalizedName.includes('printing');

if (isEmbroideryPrinting && stageData.outsourced === false) {
  // Use in-house template for embroidery/printing
  templateKey = 'embroidery_printing_inhouse';
}
```

## Operations Defined for Each Stage

### üìã **Material Calculation Stage**
1. Review Production Request
2. Verify Material Availability
3. Calculate Exact Quantities
4. Create Material Requisition
5. Approve Material Plan

### ‚úÇÔ∏è **Cutting Stage**
1. Prepare Cutting Table
2. Fabric Spreading
3. Pattern Marking
4. Cut Fabric
5. Bundle and Label
6. Quality Check

### üé® **Embroidery/Printing Stage (Outsourced)**
1. Design Selection
2. Prepare Work Order
3. **Send to Vendor** üöö (outsourced)
4. **Track Vendor Progress** üöö (outsourced)
5. **Receive from Vendor** üöö (outsourced)
6. Quality Inspection

### üé® **Embroidery/Printing Stage (In-House)**
1. Design Selection
2. Prepare Machine Setup
3. Test Run
4. Production Run
5. Drying/Curing
6. Quality Inspection

### üßµ **Stitching Stage**
1. Prepare Sewing Machines
2. Thread Color Matching
3. Assemble Garment Parts
4. Seam Finishing
5. Attach Accessories
6. In-line Quality Check

### ‚ú® **Finishing Stage**
1. Thread Trimming
2. Washing
3. Drying
4. Ironing/Pressing
5. Spot Cleaning
6. Final Touch-up

### ‚úÖ **Quality Control Stage**
1. Visual Inspection
2. Measurement Check
3. Color Consistency
4. Stitch Quality
5. Accessories Check
6. Final Approval

### üì¶ **Packaging Stage**
1. Fold Garments
2. Attach Tags
3. Pack in Poly Bags
4. Box Packing
5. Carton Labeling
6. Ready for Shipment

## How It Works

### When Creating a New Production Order:

1. **User starts production** from Manufacturing Dashboard
2. **Backend creates production order** with 6 default stages
3. **For each stage created**:
   - System checks the stage name
   - Maps it to the correct template
   - For embroidery/printing, checks if outsourced
   - Creates all operations from the template
   - Marks outsourced operations with `is_outsourced: true`
   - Assigns vendor_id if applicable

4. **Result**: Production order is created with all stages and operations ready to track

### Visual Indicators in UI:

- **Outsourced operations** show a purple badge with truck icon üöö
- **Vendor name** is displayed below outsourced operations
- **Start/End dates** are tracked for each operation
- **Status workflow**: pending ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí completed

## Testing the Implementation

### To verify operations are created:

1. **Create a new production order** from Manufacturing Dashboard
2. **Click "Track Production"** on the order
3. **Expand any stage** - you should now see operations listed
4. **Check embroidery/printing stage**:
   - If outsourced: Should show "Send to Vendor", "Track Vendor Progress", etc.
   - If in-house: Should show "Prepare Machine Setup", "Test Run", etc.

### Expected Console Output:

```
Created 6 production stages
Created 5 operations for stage: Calculate Material Review (outsourced: false)
Created 6 operations for stage: Cutting (outsourced: false)
Created 6 operations for stage: Embroidery or Printing (outsourced: true)
Created 6 operations for stage: Stitching (outsourced: false)
Created 6 operations for stage: Finishing (outsourced: false)
Created 6 operations for stage: Quality Check (outsourced: false)
```

## Benefits

‚úÖ **No more empty stages** - All stages have predefined operations
‚úÖ **Clear workflow** - Users know exactly what needs to be done
‚úÖ **Outsourcing support** - Different operations for outsourced vs in-house
‚úÖ **Vendor tracking** - Outsourced operations clearly marked
‚úÖ **Consistent process** - Same operations for same stage types
‚úÖ **Flexible** - Can still add custom operations if needed

## Files Modified

1. **server/routes/manufacturing.js** - Added automatic operation creation loop
2. **server/utils/stageTemplates.js** - Enhanced with:
   - Better stage name mapping
   - Separate in-house embroidery/printing template
   - Smart template selection based on outsourced flag

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Add more stage templates** for specialized production types
2. **Allow custom operation templates** per product category
3. **Operation dependencies** - some operations must complete before others start
4. **Time estimates** - add estimated duration for each operation
5. **Resource allocation** - assign machines/workers to operations

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED**

All production orders created from now on will automatically have operations generated for each stage based on the stage type and outsourcing configuration.
