# Outsourcing & Material Reconciliation Endpoints - Implementation Complete

## 🎯 Problem Summary

The Production Operations View page was failing with multiple 404 errors because **the outsourcing and material reconciliation endpoints documented in `PRODUCTION_OPERATIONS_SIMPLIFIED.md` were never actually implemented in the backend**.

### Errors Encountered
```
❌ 404 - POST /api/manufacturing/stages/:id/outsource/outward
❌ 404 - POST /api/manufacturing/stages/:id/outsource/inward
❌ Missing - GET /api/manufacturing/orders/:orderId/materials/reconciliation
❌ Missing - POST /api/manufacturing/orders/:orderId/materials/reconcile
```

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### **4 New Endpoints Added to `server/routes/manufacturing.js`**

---

### 1️⃣ **Create Outward Challan** (Line 610-667)
```http
POST /api/manufacturing/stages/:id/outsource/outward
```

**Purpose:** Send materials to external vendor for outsourcing (embroidery, printing, washing)

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "vendor_id": 1,
  "items": [
    {
      "product_name": "T-Shirts",
      "quantity": 100,
      "rate": 50,
      "description": "Embroidery work"
    }
  ],
  "expected_return_date": "2025-02-15",
  "notes": "Handle with care",
  "transport_details": {
    "mode": "Truck",
    "vehicle_number": "MH01AB1234"
  }
}
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Creates an outward challan in the `challans` table
- ✅ Links challan to production stage via `stage_operations` table
- ✅ Updates stage status to `in_progress` and marks as `outsourced`
- ✅ Generates unique challan number: `CHN-YYYYMMDD-XXXX`

---

### 2️⃣ **Create Inward Challan** (Line 669-733)
```http
POST /api/manufacturing/stages/:id/outsource/inward
```

**Purpose:** Record receipt of materials from vendor after outsourcing work is completed

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "outward_challan_id": 123,
  "items": [...],
  "received_quantity": 95,
  "quality_notes": "Good quality work",
  "discrepancies": "5 pieces damaged"
}
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Creates inward/return challan in the `challans` table
- ✅ Marks original outward challan as `completed`
- ✅ Updates `stage_operation` with `return_challan_id`
- ✅ Records quality inspection notes and discrepancies

---

### 3️⃣ **Get Materials for Reconciliation** (Line 1885-1939)
```http
GET /api/manufacturing/orders/:orderId/materials/reconciliation
```

**Purpose:** Fetch all material allocations for final stage reconciliation

**Response:**
```json
{
  "materials": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "inventory_id": 45,
      "item_name": "Cotton Fabric",
      "category": "fabric",
      "barcode": "BAR-001",
      "unit": "meters",
      "quantity_allocated": 100,
      "quantity_consumed": 80,
      "quantity_wasted": 5,
      "quantity_returned": 0,
      "quantity_remaining": 15,
      "status": "in_use"
    }
  ]
}
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Retrieves all `material_allocations` for the production order
- ✅ Calculates remaining quantity automatically
- ✅ Includes inventory details (name, barcode, unit)

---

### 4️⃣ **Submit Material Reconciliation** (Line 1941-2016)
```http
POST /api/manufacturing/orders/:orderId/materials/reconcile
```

**Purpose:** Complete material reconciliation and return leftovers to inventory

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "materials": [
    {
      "allocation_id": 1,
      "actual_consumed": 85,
      "actual_wasted": 5,
      "leftover_quantity": 10,
      "notes": "Slightly more fabric used than expected"
    }
  ],
  "notes": "Final stage reconciliation completed"
}
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Updates `material_allocations` with actual consumption and wastage
- ✅ Marks allocation status as `reconciled`
- ✅ **Returns leftover materials to inventory** by updating `inventory.quantity_on_hand`
- ✅ Creates `inventory_movements` records for audit trail
- ✅ Returns summary of what was returned

---

## 🔄 How the Outsourcing Flow Works

### **Step 1: Mark Stage as Outsourced**
User selects work type as "Outsourced" in Production Operations View

### **Step 2: Create Outward Challan**
```
User clicks "Create Outward Challan"
  ↓
POST /manufacturing/stages/:id/outsource/outward
  ↓
✅ Challan created in `challans` table
✅ StageOperation created linking challan to stage
✅ Stage marked as outsourced with vendor_id
```

### **Step 3: Vendor Completes Work**
External vendor performs embroidery/printing/washing work

### **Step 4: Create Inward Challan**
```
User clicks "Create Inward Challan"
  ↓
POST /manufacturing/stages/:id/outsource/inward
  ↓
✅ Inward challan created
✅ Outward challan marked completed
✅ StageOperation updated with return_challan_id
✅ Quality notes and discrepancies recorded
```

### **Step 5: View Audit Trail**
```
GET /manufacturing/stages/:id/challans
  ↓
Returns all challans (outward + inward) for the stage
```

---

## 🔄 How Material Reconciliation Works

### **When Final Stage is Reached**

### **Step 1: Open Reconciliation Dialog**
```
User clicks "Open Material Reconciliation"
  ↓
GET /manufacturing/orders/:orderId/materials/reconciliation
  ↓
✅ Shows all allocated materials with current usage
✅ Auto-calculates leftover quantity
```

### **Step 2: Update Actual Usage**
User edits:
- Actual consumed quantity
- Actual wasted quantity
- System auto-calculates leftover

### **Step 3: Submit Reconciliation**
```
User clicks "Submit Reconciliation"
  ↓
POST /manufacturing/orders/:orderId/materials/reconcile
  ↓
✅ MaterialAllocation updated with actuals
✅ Leftover materials returned to Inventory
✅ InventoryMovement records created
✅ Allocation marked as 'reconciled'
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Script Created: `test-outsourcing-endpoints.js`
Run with:
```bash
node test-outsourcing-endpoints.js
```

Expected output: All endpoints should return **401 (Unauthorized)** instead of **404 (Not Found)**, proving they are registered.

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Test Outward Challan Creation:**
   - Navigate to Production Tracking
   - Click eye icon on a production order
   - Select an embroidery/printing stage
   - Select "Outsourced" work type
   - Click "Create Outward Challan"
   - Fill vendor details and submit
   - ✅ Should succeed without 404 error

2. **Test Inward Challan Creation:**
   - After outward challan is created
   - Click "Create Inward Challan"
   - Select the outward challan
   - Enter received quantity and quality notes
   - Submit
   - ✅ Should succeed and mark outward challan complete

3. **Test Material Reconciliation:**
   - Navigate to final stage of production
   - Click "Open Material Reconciliation"
   - ✅ Should load allocated materials without 404
   - Update actual consumption and wastage
   - Submit
   - ✅ Should complete and return leftovers to inventory

## 🔍 Related Data Models

### Tables Involved
1. **challans** - Stores outward and inward challans
2. **stage_operations** - Links challans to production stages
3. **production_stages** - Tracks stage status and outsourcing info
4. **material_allocations** - Tracks material usage per production order
5. **inventory** - Updated when leftovers are returned
6. **inventory_movements** - Audit trail for material returns

### Key Relationships
```
ProductionStage
  ↓ has many
StageOperation
  ↓ has one
Challan (outward) + Challan (return)

ProductionOrder
  ↓ has many
MaterialAllocation
  ↓ belongs to
Inventory
```

## 📋 Authentication & Permissions

All endpoints require:
- ✅ Valid JWT token in Authorization header
- ✅ User department: `manufacturing` or `admin`

---

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

### Server Restart Required
After adding these endpoints, the Node.js server must be restarted:
```bash
# Stop the server
Stop-Process -Name node -Force

# Start the server
cd d:\Projects\passion-clothing\server
node index.js
```

### No Database Migration Needed
These endpoints use existing tables:
- `challans`
- `stage_operations`
- `production_stages`
- `material_allocations`
- `inventory`
- `inventory_movements`

All necessary columns already exist.
