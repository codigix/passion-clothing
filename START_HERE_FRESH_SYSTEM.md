## ❓ QUESTION 1: Why Buttons Disabled?

### Simple Answer

You're trying to verify materials for a **Production REQUEST** that hasn't been **started** yet!

```
Think of it like ordering pizza:

📞 You call pizza shop (Production REQUEST created)
   ↓
   "We received your order" ← YOU ARE HERE
   ↓
👨‍🍳 Chef starts making pizza (Click "Start Production")
   ↓
🍕 Pizza is being made (Production ORDER active)
   ↓
✅ Now you can track it, verify ingredients, check stages
```

### What You Need To Do RIGHT NOW

```
1. Go to Manufacturing Dashboard
2. Look at "Incoming Orders" tab
3. Find order: PRQ-20250101-00003
4. See the green ▶️ "Start Production" button
5. CLICK IT!
6. Watch order move to "Active Orders" tab
7. NOW buttons are enabled! ✅
```

## 💡 KEY TAKEAWAYS

### The Core Concept
```
Production REQUEST ≠ Production ORDER

REQUEST = "Please make this" (just a request)
ORDER = "We're making this" (actual work)

You MUST click "Start Production" to convert REQUEST → ORDER

Then buttons enable ✅
```

### The Solution
```
Option 1: Click "Start Production" button (quick)
Option 2: Reset database + test fresh (thorough)
```

### The Flow
```
Sales Order → Production Request → [Start Production] → Production Order → Material Verification → Stages → Complete
```
