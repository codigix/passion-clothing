# PO Status Update - Quick Reference

## 🎯 What Was Changed

After creating a PO from a Sales Order, the system now:
- ✅ **Saves the link** between PO and Sales Order in database
- ✅ **Updates Sales Order status** to "procurement_created"
- ✅ **Sends notifications** to Sales and Procurement departments
- ✅ **Auto-navigates** back to dashboard (1.5 seconds after creation)
- ✅ **Shows "PO Created ✓"** green badge in dashboard immediately
