# ✅ START PRODUCTION BUTTON - NOW WORKING!

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

**Problem:** After manufacturing received materials from inventory, the **"Start Production"** button was not enabled.

**Root Cause:** Sales Order status was not being updated to `materials_received` after materials were received.

**Solution:** Updated the material receipt process to automatically:
1. ✅ Update Sales Order status to `materials_received`
2. 🔔 Send notification to Manufacturing: "Ready for Production"
3. 📝 Add audit trail to Sales Order lifecycle history
