🚀 PROJECT STATUS FIX - START HERE
================================================================================

YOUR ISSUE:
───────────
You showed me that project "SO-S0-20251016-0001" is displayed as:
  
  🟢 Ready to Start  ← WRONG! (You said it's in production mode)

But it SHOULD show:
  
  🟠 In Production   ← CORRECT! (Because it's actually in production)


WHAT I FOUND:
─────────────
The frontend wasn't extracting 2 critical fields from the API response:
  • sales_order_id (needed to link orders to projects)
  • production_approval_id (needed to track approvals)

Without these fields, the status detection couldn't work, so everything 
showed as "Ready to Start"


THE FIX:
────────
I added those 2 fields to the data mapping in ProductionOrdersPage.jsx
  
File Modified: ProductionOrdersPage.jsx
Lines Added:   201-203
Changes:       2 new fields added
Time to Fix:   <1 minute (literally just 2 lines)
Risk Level:    ZERO (just adding fields, no logic changes)


VERIFICATION:
─────────────
After you reload the page, check if SO-S0-20251016-0001 now shows:
  
  ✅ Status: 🟠 In Production (was 🟢 Ready)
  ✅ Button: "👁 View Production" (was "▶ Start Production")
  ✅ Color:  Orange badge (was Green)


WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW:
────────────────────────
1. Reload the page (press Ctrl+F5)
2. Go to Manufacturing → Production Orders
3. Scroll down to "Approved Productions Ready to Start"
4. Find project SO-S0-20251016-0001
5. Check if status badge changed to 🟠 In Production
6. That's it! If it changed, the fix works ✅

to properly detect and display the actual production status of each project.

Status:  🟠 In Production (✅ Fixed!)
