# 🎉 Production Wizard - Complete Backend Integration

## ✅ Integration Status: COMPLETE

The Production Wizard has been fully integrated with the database backend. All 7 wizard steps now save and retrieve data correctly with full relational database support.

---

## 📋 What Was Completed

### 1. Backend Database Schema
Created comprehensive database tables to support all wizard features:

#### **material_requirements table**
- Tracks all materials needed for production orders
- Fields: `material_id`, `description`, `required_quantity`, `allocated_quantity`, `consumed_quantity`, `unit`, `status`, `notes`
- Supports full lifecycle: required → allocated → consumed
- Status enum: `available`, `shortage`, `ordered`, `allocated`, `consumed`

#### **quality_checkpoints table**
- Manages quality control checkpoints for production orders
- Fields: `name`, `frequency`, `acceptance_criteria`, `checkpoint_order`, `status`, `checked_at`, `checked_by`, `result`, `notes`
- Optional link to specific production stages via `production_stage_id`
- Frequency options: `per_batch`, `per_unit`, `per_stage`, `hourly`, `daily`, `final`
- Checkpoint sequencing with `checkpoint_order` field

#### **Enhanced production_orders table**
- Added team assignment fields:
  - `supervisor_id` - Links to supervisor user
  - `qa_lead_id` - Links to QA lead user
  - `shift` - Enum: `morning`, `afternoon`, `evening`, `night`, `day`, `flexible`
  - `team_notes` - Additional team coordination notes
  - `estimated_hours` - Planned production time

#### **Enhanced production_stages table**
- Converted `stage_name` from ENUM to VARCHAR(100)
- Now supports unlimited custom stage names
- Tracks planned and actual duration for each stage

### 2. Backend API Enhancements

#### **POST /api/manufacturing/orders** - Fully Rewritten
Now processes ALL 7 wizard steps:

**Step 1: Order Details**
```javascript
{
  product_id: number,
  quantity: number,
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'urgent',
  production_type: 'in_house' | 'outsourced' | 'mixed',
  sales_order_id: number (optional),
  special_instructions: string (optional)
}
```

**Step 2: Scheduling**
```javascript
{
  planned_start_date: 'YYYY-MM-DD',
  planned_end_date: 'YYYY-MM-DD',
  shift: 'morning' | 'afternoon' | 'evening' | 'night' | 'day' | 'flexible',
  estimated_hours: number
}
```

**Step 3: Materials**
```javascript
{
  materials_required: [
    {
      materialId: string,        // Material identifier
      description: string,        // Material description
      requiredQuantity: number,   // Quantity needed
      unit: string,               // Meters, Kg, Pcs, etc.
      status: 'available' | 'shortage' | 'ordered'
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 4: Quality Parameters**
```javascript
{
  quality_parameters: [
    {
      name: string,                    // Checkpoint name
      frequency: string,               // per_batch, per_unit, etc.
      acceptanceCriteria: string       // Quality standards
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 5: Team Assignments**
```javascript
{
  supervisor_id: number,     // Supervisor user ID
  assigned_user_id: number,  // Assigned worker ID (mapped to assigned_to)
  qa_lead_id: number,        // QA lead user ID
  team_notes: string         // Coordination notes
}
```

**Step 6: Custom Stages**
```javascript
{
  use_custom_stages: boolean,
  stages: [
    {
      stageName: string,              // Custom stage name (unlimited length)
      plannedDurationHours: number    // Estimated hours for this stage
    }
  ]
}
```

**Default Stages** (when `use_custom_stages` is false):
1. Calculate Material Review (4h)
2. Cutting (8h)
3. Embroidery or Printing (12h)
4. Stitching (10h)
5. Finishing (6h)
6. Quality Check (4h)

**Step 7: Review & Submit**
- Validates all previous steps
- Creates production order with all related records
- Sends notifications to manufacturing team

#### **GET /api/manufacturing/orders/:id** - Enhanced Retrieval
Returns complete production order with all associations:
```javascript
{
  id: number,
  production_number: string,
  status: string,
  priority: string,
  quantity: number,
  shift: string,
  estimated_hours: number,
  team_notes: string,
  // User associations
  supervisor: { id, name, employee_id },
  assignedUser: { id, name, employee_id },
  qaLead: { id, name, employee_id },
  // Related records
  materialRequirements: [
    {
      material_id: string,
      description: string,
      required_quantity: number,
      allocated_quantity: number,
      consumed_quantity: number,
      unit: string,
      status: string,
      notes: string
    }
  ],
  qualityCheckpoints: [
    {
      name: string,
      frequency: string,
      acceptance_criteria: string,
      checkpoint_order: number,
      status: 'pending' | 'passed' | 'failed',
      checked_at: datetime,
      checked_by: number,
      result: string,
      notes: string
    }
  ],
  stages: [
    {
      stage_name: string,
      stage_order: number,
      status: string,
      planned_duration_hours: number,
      actual_duration_hours: number,
      // ... other stage fields
    }
  ]
}
```

## 📊 Database Field Mappings

### Frontend → Backend Field Name Translations

The frontend wizard uses camelCase while the database uses snake_case. The backend automatically handles these mappings:

| Frontend Field | Backend Column | Notes |
|---------------|----------------|-------|
| `productId` | `product_id` | Product foreign key |
| `salesOrderId` | `sales_order_id` | Optional SO link |
| `productionType` | `production_type` | in_house/outsourced/mixed |
| `plannedStartDate` | `planned_start_date` | Date only |
| `plannedEndDate` | `planned_end_date` | Date only |
| `estimatedHours` | `estimated_hours` | Decimal/float |
| `specialInstructions` | `special_instructions` | Long text |
| `materials_required[]` | `material_requirements` table | Array → rows |
| `materialId` | `material_id` | Material identifier |
| `requiredQuantity` | `required_quantity` | Numeric |
| `quality_parameters[]` | `quality_checkpoints` table | Array → rows |
| `acceptanceCriteria` | `acceptance_criteria` | Text field |
| `supervisorId` | `supervisor_id` | User FK |
| `assigned_user_id` | `assigned_to` | User FK (note difference!) |
| `qaLeadId` | `qa_lead_id` | User FK |
| `team_notes` | `team_notes` | Long text |
| `stages[]` | `production_stages` table | Array → rows |
| `stageName` | `stage_name` | Now VARCHAR(100) |
| `plannedDurationHours` | `planned_duration_hours` | Numeric |

   - Quick-select common checkpoints

4. **Time estimation from historical data**
   - Suggest estimated hours based on past orders
   - Stage duration recommendations

5. **Progress saving as draft**
   - Save partial wizard progress
   - Resume later without data loss

6. **Wizard prefill from existing orders**

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Invalid product_id Error
**Symptom:** Console warning "Invalid product_id detected: OTH-CUST-7741"

**Cause:** The quick "Start Production" button on the dashboard tries to create a basic order, but some orders have product_code (string) instead of product_id (number)

**Solution:** The system now detects this and opens a product selection dialog as a fallback. **Better approach:** Use the Production Wizard button instead for full control.

### Issue: ENUM Error on Custom Stages
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Previous Error:** Custom stage names were rejected because `stage_name` was an ENUM

**Fix Applied:** Migration converted `stage_name` to VARCHAR(100), now supports unlimited custom names

### Issue: Sales Orders 404 Error in Wizard
**Status:** ✅ FIXED (Jan 10, 2025)

**Previous Error:** Console errors when loading sales orders: "404 /api/sales/orders/summary"

**Cause:** Frontend was calling non-existent `/sales/orders/summary` endpoint

**Fix Applied:** Changed to correct endpoint `/sales/orders` and fixed response data structure mapping

**Details:** See `PRODUCTION_WIZARD_ERROR_FIXES.md`
