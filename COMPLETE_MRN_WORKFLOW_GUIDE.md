- Network tab → XHR
- Find POST/GET request
- Response contains ID

### **Method 3: From Database**
```sql
-- Get dispatch ID from MRN
SELECT id, dispatch_number, mrn_request_id 
FROM material_dispatches 
WHERE mrn_request_id = {your_mrn_id};

-- Get receipt ID from dispatch
SELECT id, receipt_number, dispatch_id 
FROM material_receipts 
WHERE dispatch_id = {your_dispatch_id};

-- Get verification ID from receipt
SELECT id, verification_number, receipt_id 
FROM material_verifications 
WHERE receipt_id = {your_receipt_id};
```

### **Method 4: From List Pages (Coming Soon)**

**Solution:** Routes already added to App.jsx ✅

### **Issue: "Dispatch ID not found"**
**Solution:** 
1. Check if dispatch was created successfully
2. View network response in browser DevTools
3. Query database for dispatch_id

### **Issue: "Cannot find receipt"**
**Solution:**
1. Ensure receipt was submitted successfully
2. Check material_receipts table
3. Verify dispatch_id is correct
