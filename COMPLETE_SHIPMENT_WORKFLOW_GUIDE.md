## 🔧 Integration Steps (REMAINING)

### Step 1: Add Route to Frontend Router
**File:** `client/src/App.js` or your routing configuration

```jsx
import ShipmentManagementPage from './pages/manufacturing/ShipmentManagementPage';

// Add to your routes:
{
  path: '/manufacturing/shipments',
  element: <ShipmentManagementPage />,
  requiredDepartment: ['manufacturing', 'shipment', 'admin']
}
```

### Step 2: Add Navigation Menu Item
**File:** `client/src/components/layout/Sidebar.js` (or your navigation component)

```jsx
{
  title: 'Shipments',
  icon: Truck,
  path: '/manufacturing/shipments',
  badge: activeShipments > 0 ? activeShipments : null,
  subMenu: [
    { title: 'All Shipments', path: '/manufacturing/shipments' },
    { title: 'Create Shipment', path: '/manufacturing/shipments?tab=1' }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Update Manufacturing Dashboard
**File:** `client/src/pages/manufacturing/ManufacturingDashboard.jsx`

Add Shipments tab:
```jsx
<Tab label="Shipments" icon={<Truck className="w-5 h-5" />} />
<TabPanel value={tabIndex} index={7}>
  <ShipmentManagementPage />
</TabPanel>
```

### Step 4: Add to ProductionOrdersPage Status Display
**File:** `client/src/pages/manufacturing/ProductionOrdersPage.jsx`

Show shipment status in the production orders table:
```jsx
import ShipmentStatusBadge from '../../components/shipment/ShipmentStatusBadge';

// In your table:
<TableCell>
  {order.shipment_id ? (
    <ShipmentStatusBadge status={order.shipment?.status || 'preparing'} />
  ) : (
    <span className="text-gray-500 text-sm">No shipment</span>
  )}
</TableCell>
```

### Step 5: Update Production Order API Response
**File:** `server/routes/manufacturing.js`

Ensure shipment data is included in production order responses:
```javascript
// When fetching production orders, include shipment:
{
  model: Shipment,
  as: 'shipment',
  attributes: ['id', 'shipment_number', 'status', 'tracking_number']
}
```

### Step 6: Add Notification Service Methods
**File:** `server/utils/notificationService.js`

Add shipment-specific notifications:
```javascript
static async notifyShipmentCreated(shipment, userId) {
  // Notify shipment department about new shipment
}

static async notifyShipmentStatusChange(shipment, oldStatus, newStatus) {
  // Notify relevant parties about status change
}

static async notifyCustomerShipmentUpdate(shipment, updateText) {
  // Notify customer via email/SMS
}
```
