# üî• COMPLETE DATABASE RESET - Start Fresh

## What This Does

This will **DELETE EVERYTHING**:
- ‚úÖ All users (including admin)
- ‚úÖ All sales orders
- ‚úÖ All purchase orders  
- ‚úÖ All production requests/orders
- ‚úÖ All inventory items
- ‚úÖ All GRN records
- ‚úÖ All mock/test data
- ‚úÖ ALL data from ALL tables

After reset, you'll have a **completely empty database** ready for REAL data testing.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Before You Start

1. **Stop the server** (press Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. **Backup** if you need anything (though you said you want to delete all mock data)
3. Make sure you're ready to start fresh

## üöÄ RESET PROCEDURE

### Step 1: Run Reset Script

```powershell
# Navigate to project root
cd d:\Projects\passion-inventory

# Run the reset script
node server/complete-database-reset.js
```

**You will be asked to confirm:**
1. Type: `DELETE ALL DATA`
2. Type: `YES`

The script will:
- Drop all tables
- Remove all data
- Keep only SequelizeMeta (migration tracking)

---

### Step 2: Run Migrations

```powershell
# Navigate to server directory
cd server

# Run all migrations to recreate tables
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

This recreates all tables with proper structure (empty, no data).

---

### Step 3: Create Admin User

```powershell
# Still in server directory
node create-admin-quick.js
```

This creates the default admin user:
- **Username:** admin
- **Password:** admin123
- **Email:** admin@passion.com
- **Role:** Admin
- **Department:** admin

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Change the password after first login!

---

### Step 4: Create Department Users (Optional)

You can create users for each department:

```powershell
# Still in server directory
node scripts/createInventoryUser.js   # Creates inventory user
```

Or create them manually through the Admin Dashboard after logging in:
1. Login as admin
2. Go to Admin ‚Üí Users
3. Click "Add User"
4. Fill details for each department:
   - Sales user (department: sales)
   - Procurement user (department: procurement)
   - Manufacturing user (department: manufacturing)
   - Inventory user (department: inventory)

---

### Step 5: Start Server

```powershell
# Navigate back to project root
cd ..

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Server should start on:
- Backend: http://localhost:5000
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000

---

### Step 6: Login and Test

1. Open browser: http://localhost:3000
2. Login with admin credentials
3. Start testing with REAL data flow!
