## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Sidebar is better for action-oriented features** - Dedicated pages > tabs
2. **Dashboard should focus on monitoring** - Metrics and stats, not complex workflows
3. **Leverage existing components** - OutsourcingDashboard already existed
4. **Clean removal** - Remove all related state, functions, and content
5. **Documentation is key** - Both technical and user-facing docs important

## 🔮 Future Work

The following outsourcing routes are placeholders and need implementation:

```javascript
/outsourcing/outward     → Outward Challans Page (placeholder)
/outsourcing/inward      → Inward Challans Page (placeholder)
/outsourcing/tracking    → Vendor Tracking Page (placeholder)
```

Consider implementing:
- Full outward challan creation and management
- Inward challan receipt and verification
- Real-time vendor tracking with status updates
- Vendor performance analytics dashboard
- Cost analysis and comparison tools
