# 🎯 Sales → Procurement Approval Flow - FIX SUMMARY

## ✅ **ISSUE IDENTIFIED & FIXED**

### **Problem:**
The "Send to Procurement" button was appearing on **CONFIRMED** orders instead of **DRAFT** orders, which prevented the approval workflow from working correctly.

### **Solution:**
Modified `SalesDashboard.jsx` to show the button only for DRAFT orders that haven't been sent yet.

## 📝 **What Was Changed**

### File Modified:

{order.status === 'confirmed' && (
  <button onClick={handleSendToProcurement}>
    Send to Procurement

```javascript
{/* Show button only for DRAFT orders not yet sent */}
{order.status === 'draft' && !order.ready_for_procurement && (
  <button onClick={handleSendToProcurement}>
    Send to Procurement for Approval
  </button>
)}

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

### Button Visibility Rules:

| Order Status | ready_for_procurement | Button Shown |
|--------------|----------------------|--------------|
| draft | false | 📤 **Send to Procurement** |
| draft | true | ⏳ **Awaiting Approval** |
| confirmed | true | (none - already approved) |
| in_production | true | (none - workflow progressed) |

---

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### Condition Logic:

```javascript
// Show button when:
order.status === 'draft' 
  && !order.ready_for_procurement

// Show waiting indicator when:
order.status === 'draft' 
  && order.ready_for_procurement
```

### Database Fields:

```javascript
SalesOrder {
  status: 'draft' | 'confirmed' | ...,
  ready_for_procurement: boolean,
  ready_for_procurement_by: user_id,
  ready_for_procurement_at: timestamp,
  approved_by: user_id,
  approved_at: timestamp
}
```
