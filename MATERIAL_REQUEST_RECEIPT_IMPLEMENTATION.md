### 2. **Production Dashboard - Material Receipt Tab (ProductionDashboardPage.jsx)**

#### New Components:
- **Dashboard Tab System**:
  - Production Orders (existing)
  - Material Receipts (new)

#### Material Receipt Table Columns:
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Receipt # | Unique receipt identifier |
| Dispatch # | Associated dispatch number |
| Project | Project name for tracking |
| Materials | Count of items with expandable preview |
| Status | Color-coded status badge |
| Received By | User who received materials |
| Date | Receipt creation date |

#### Advanced Filters for Material Receipts:
1. **Status Filter** (Dropdown):
   - All Status
   - Received (✓ green)
   - Discrepancy (✗ red)
   - Pending (⏳ yellow)

2. **Date Range Filters**:
   - Date From (with date picker)
   - Date To (with date picker)
   - Pre-calculated date ranges possible (Last 7/30 days)

3. **Project Filter** (Text input):
   - Filter by project name/code

   - Real-time search with instant results

#### Filter Logic:
```javascript
// Cumulative filtering
if (search) filter by search term
if (status) filter by status
if (project) filter by project
if (material) filter by material type
if (dateFrom) filter >= start date
if (dateTo) filter <= end date
// Result: Only receipts matching ALL applied filters
```

Status | Date From | Date To | Project | Material Type | Reset
    ↓
Responsive Receipt Table
(Overflow handling on mobile)
    ↓
Empty State (when no data)
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Fetching

#### Material Receipts Endpoint:
```javascript
GET /material-receipt/list/pending-verification
Response: Array of receipt objects
```

#### Data Structure Expected:
```javascript
{
  id: number,
  receipt_number: string,
  dispatch_number: string,
  project_name: string,
  received_status: 'received' | 'discrepancy' | 'pending',
  receiver: { name: string },
  created_at: datetime,
  dispatched_materials: [
    {
      material_name: string,
      material_type: string,
      quantity_dispatched: number,
      uom: string
    }
  ]
}
```

### State Management

#### Material Requirements Page:
```javascript
States:
- materialRequests[] - all fetched requests
- filteredRequests[] - filtered by search/filters
- viewMode: 'table' | 'cards'
- visibleColumns[] - localStorage persisted
- searchTerm, statusFilter, priorityFilter, projectFilter
- showFilters, showColumnMenu
```

#### Production Dashboard:
```javascript
States:
- materialReceipts[] - all fetched receipts
- filteredReceipts[] - filtered results
- dashboardTab: 'production' | 'material-receipt'
- Receipt filters: status, dateFrom, dateTo, project, materialType
- showReceiptFilters
```

### LocalStorage Keys:
- `materialRequestsVisibleColumns`: Stores selected column visibility

### Filter Composition:
All filters work together in AND logic (not OR):
- Search: Checks multiple fields
- Status: Exact match
- Priority: Exact match
- Project: Exact match
- Date Range: Between inclusive
- Material Type: Partial match

---

## Responsive Design

### Breakpoints:
- **Mobile** (< 768px):
  - Single column layout for filters
  - Table scrolls horizontally
  - Column buttons show icons only
  - Compact spacing

- **Tablet** (768px - 1024px):
  - 2-4 column layout for filters
  - Table scrolls with improved visibility
  
- **Desktop** (> 1024px):
  - Full grid layout (5 columns for receipts)
  - All labels visible
  - Maximum viewing area

---

## User Workflows

### Material Requirements Management:
1. User opens Material Requirements page
2. Toggles between Table/Cards view (preference saved)
3. Uses columns button to customize visible columns
4. Uses filters for specific queries:
   - Single filter: Find by status
   - Multiple: Status + Project + Priority
5. Clicks View Details for full material request info
6. System persists column preferences

### Material Receipt Verification:
1. User clicks Material Receipts tab on Production Dashboard
2. Reviews all pending material receipts
3. Applies filters:
   - Filter by status to find discrepancies
   - Filter by date range for recent deliveries
   - Filter by project to verify specific orders
   - Filter by material type for category-specific tracking
4. Search for specific receipt or dispatch
5. Inline status display shows receipt condition
6. Can expand material details to see all items received

## API Integration Notes

### For Material Receipts:
The implementation uses the existing endpoint:
- `GET /material-receipt/list/pending-verification`

If different data needed, the endpoint can be modified to:
- Accept status filters
- Accept date range queries
- Accept project filtering
- Return paginated results

### Backend Filters Support (Optional Enhancement):
```
GET /material-receipt/list/pending-verification?status=received&fromDate=2024-01-01&toDate=2024-12-31&project=SO-001
```

## Customization Guide

### Adding New Columns to Material Requirements:
1. Add to `AVAILABLE_COLUMNS` array:
```javascript
{
  id: 'new_field',
  label: 'Display Name',
  defaultVisible: true/false,
  alwaysVisible: false
}
```

2. Add table header check:
```javascript
{isColumnVisible('new_field') && (
  <th>Display Name</th>
)}
```

3. Add table cell render:
```javascript
{isColumnVisible('new_field') && (
  <td>{request.new_field}</td>
)}
```

### Adding New Receipt Filters:
1. Add state:
```javascript
const [filterName, setFilterName] = useState('');
```

2. Add filter UI:
```javascript
<input
  value={filterName}
  onChange={(e) => setFilterName(e.target.value)}
  placeholder="..."
/>
```

3. Add to `applyReceiptFilters()`:
```javascript
if (filterName) {
  filtered = filtered.filter(receipt => 
    receipt.field === filterName
  );
}
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Sorting**: Add column sorting for tables
2. **Pagination**: Implement pagination for large datasets
3. **Export**: Add CSV/Excel export functionality
4. **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple receipts for batch operations
5. **Timeline View**: Visual timeline of material flow
6. **Advanced Analytics**: Dashboard charts for material metrics
7. **Mobile App**: Native mobile interface for material tracking
8. **Notifications**: Real-time alerts for discrepancies
9. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of receipt changes

---

## Troubleshooting

### Material Receipts Not Loading:
- Check `/material-receipt/list/pending-verification` endpoint
- Verify database has material_receipts table
- Check browser console for API errors

### Filters Not Working:
- Verify filter state is updating in React DevTools
- Check filter logic in `applyReceiptFilters()`
- Ensure data structure matches expectations

### Column Visibility Reset:
- Clear localStorage: `localStorage.removeItem('materialRequestsVisibleColumns')`
- Page will use default column visibility

### Responsive Issues:
- Test at breakpoints: 320px, 768px, 1024px
- Check overflow-x: auto on table wrapper
- Verify flex/grid responsive classes

## Performance Notes

- Material Requirements: Client-side filtering (good for <1000 records)
- Material Receipts: Consider server-side filtering for 1000+ records
- localStorage: Limited to ~5-10MB (column configs are minimal)
- Filters apply immediately (real-time search)
