## 🔧 Technical Details

### New State Variable

```

### Request Categorization
```javascript
const isCompletedStatus = (status) => {
  return ['fulfilled', 'completed', 'rejected', 'cancelled', 'partially_fulfilled'].includes(status);
};

const activeRequests = filteredRequests.filter(r => !isCompletedStatus(r.status));
const pastRequests = filteredRequests.filter(r => isCompletedStatus(r.status));
```

### Updated Stats
```javascript
const stats = {
  total: filteredRequests.length,
  pending: filteredRequests.filter(r => r.status === 'pending').length,
  approved: filteredRequests.filter(r => r.status === 'approved' || r.status === 'in_progress').length,
  fulfilled: filteredRequests.filter(r => r.status === 'fulfilled').length,
  urgent: filteredRequests.filter(r => r.priority === 'urgent').length,
  active: activeRequests.length,      // NEW
  past: pastRequests.length             // NEW
};
```

## 🎨 Design Elements
