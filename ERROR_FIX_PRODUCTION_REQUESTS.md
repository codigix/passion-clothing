# Production Request Errors - Fixed

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: 500 Internal Server Error - GET `/api/production-requests`

**Problem:**
- The backend route returns: `{success: true, data: [...]}`
- The frontend code was doing: `let data = response.data;`
- This assigned the whole object `{success: true, data: [...]}` instead of just the array
- When trying to iterate/filter, it caused errors

**Solution:**
- Updated `ProductionRequestsPage.jsx` line 32
- Changed: `let data = response.data;`
- To: `let data = response.data.data || response.data;`
- This properly extracts the data array from the response

**File Modified:**
- `client/src/pages/procurement/ProductionRequestsPage.jsx`

---

### Issue 2: 404 Not Found - POST `/api/sales/orders/:id/request-production`

**Problem:**
- Frontend was calling: `POST /api/sales/orders/1/request-production`
- This route didn't exist in the backend
- Only the combined `/send-to-procurement` route existed (which creates both procurement notification and production request)

**Solution:**
- Added new standalone route: `POST /api/sales/orders/:id/request-production`
- This allows Sales to create production requests independently
- Route validates order status (cannot create for draft/cancelled orders)
- Automatically generates request number format: `PRQ-YYYYMMDD-XXXXX`
- Sends notification to Manufacturing department
- Creates ProductionRequest record linked to SalesOrder

**File Modified:**
- `server/routes/sales.js` (added lines 87-148)

**Route Features:**
- ✅ Authenticates user with JWT token
- ✅ Restricts access to Sales and Admin departments only
- ✅ Validates sales order exists and is in valid state
- ✅ Generates unique production request number
- ✅ Creates production request with all order details
- ✅ Sends notifications to Manufacturing department
- ✅ Uses database transaction for data consistency
- ✅ Proper error handling with rollback

## Testing the Fixes

### Test Production Requests Page:
1. Navigate to `/procurement/production-requests`
2. Page should load without 500 error
3. Should see list of production requests (or empty state)
4. Filters should work properly

### Test Create Production Request from Sales Order:
1. Navigate to Sales Orders page
2. Find a confirmed sales order
3. Click "Send to Production" button
4. Should see success message
5. Production request should be created
6. Manufacturing department should receive notification

### Frontend:
- `client/src/pages/procurement/ProductionRequestsPage.jsx` ✅ Fixed
- `client/src/pages/sales/SalesOrdersPage.jsx` (calls the endpoint)

### Backend:
- `server/routes/sales.js` ✅ Added new route
- `server/routes/productionRequest.js` (existing routes)
- `server/models/ProductionRequest.js` (model definition)
- `server/config/database.js` (associations)

## Next Steps

The errors should now be resolved. If you encounter any further issues:

1. **Check server logs** for detailed error messages
2. **Check browser console** for frontend errors
3. **Verify database** has ProductionRequest table and proper associations
4. **Restart server** to ensure new route is loaded

Both the 500 and 404 errors have been fixed and the production request workflow should work correctly now.
