## ✨ What's New?

### The Problem We Solved
Previously, the Material Requirements page only showed active/current requests. Users had no easy way to view:
- Completed requests ✓
- Fulfilled orders 📦
- Rejected requests ✗
- Cancelled orders ⏸️

### The Solution
A new collapsible **"Past Orders/Requests"** section that:
- ✅ Displays completed, fulfilled, rejected, or cancelled requests
- ✅ Shows their specific status with color-coded badges
- ✅ Works in both table and card views
- ✅ Includes search and filter support
- ✅ Hidden by default to reduce clutter
- ✅ Expandable with a single click

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Automatic Categorization
```
Active Requests (5)          Past Requests (3)
├─ Pending (2)              ├─ Fulfilled (1)
├─ Approved (2)             ├─ Rejected (1)
└─ In Progress (1)          └─ Cancelled (1)
```

### 2. Show/Hide Toggle
- Click **"▶ SHOW"** to expand past requests
- Click **"▼ HIDE"** to collapse them
- Default: Hidden (to keep UI clean)

### 3. Color-Coded Status
- 🟢 **Green** = Fulfilled ✓
- 🔴 **Red** = Rejected/Cancelled ✗
- 🟡 **Yellow** = Pending
- 🟠 **Orange** = Partially Fulfilled

### 4. Dual View Support
- **Table View**: Compact grid format
- **Card View**: Detailed card layout
- Both work for active and past requests

### 5. Smart Statistics
```
Total: 8           ← All requests
Pending: 2         ← Active only
Approved: 3        ← Active only
Fulfilled: 2       ← From all requests
Active: 5          ← Non-completed
Past: 3            ← Completed/rejected/cancelled
```
