# ✅ Implementation Summary: Automatic Production Request Flow

## What Was Implemented

### The Problem
Previously, when Sales sent an order to Procurement, Manufacturing had no automated way to know about it and start planning material requirements.

### The Solution
**Automatic Production Request Creation** - When Sales sends a Sales Order to Procurement, the system now:
1. ✅ Sends notification to Procurement (existing)
2. ✅ **Automatically creates Production Request for Manufacturing** (NEW!)
3. ✅ Sends notification to Manufacturing to create MRN

## 🎯 Flow Diagram

```
Sales Order Created
       ↓
[Send to Procurement] Button Clicked
       ↓
   ┌───────────────────────┐
   │                       │
   ↓                       ↓
Procurement          Manufacturing
Notification        Production Request
   ↓                      ↓
Create PO            Create MRN
```

## 📦 What Changed

### Database
- ✅ New migration: `20250115000000-add-sales-order-to-production-requests.js`
- ✅ ProductionRequest model supports both Sales Orders and Purchase Orders
- ✅ New fields: `sales_order_id`, `sales_order_number`, `sales_notes`

### Backend
- ✅ `/api/sales/orders/:id/send-to-procurement` - Auto-creates Production Request

### Frontend
- ✅ Manufacturing Production Requests page shows:
  - Sales Order links (green badges)
  - PO links (blue badges)
  - Sales Notes (green highlight)
  - "Create MRN" button
  - "View SO" or "View PO" buttons
